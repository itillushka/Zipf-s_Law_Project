      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1801—I have just returned from a visit to my landlord—the solitary\n",
      "neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful\n",
      "country! In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a\n",
      "situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect\n",
      "misanthropist’s Heaven—and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable\n",
      "pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little\n",
      "imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes\n",
      "withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his\n",
      "fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further\n",
      "in his waistcoat, as I announced my name.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Heathcliff?” I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A nod was the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir. I do myself the honour of calling\n",
      "as soon as possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have\n",
      "not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation\n",
      "of Thrushcross Grange: I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir,” he interrupted, wincing. “I should\n",
      "not allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it—walk in!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The “walk in” was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the\n",
      "sentiment, “Go to the Deuce!” even the gate over which he leant\n",
      "manifested no sympathising movement to the words; and I think that\n",
      "circumstance determined me to accept the invitation: I felt interested\n",
      "in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he saw my horse’s breast fairly pushing the barrier, he did put\n",
      "out his hand to unchain it, and then sullenly preceded me up the\n",
      "causeway, calling, as we entered the court,—“Joseph, take Mr.\n",
      "Lockwood’s horse; and bring up some wine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here we have the whole establishment of domestics, I suppose,” was the\n",
      "reflection suggested by this compound order. “No wonder the grass grows\n",
      "up between the flags, and cattle are the only hedge-cutters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man, very old, perhaps, though hale\n",
      "and sinewy. “The Lord help us!” he soliloquised in an undertone of\n",
      "peevish displeasure, while relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime,\n",
      "in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of\n",
      "divine aid to digest his dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no\n",
      "reference to my unexpected advent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff’s dwelling. “Wuthering”\n",
      "being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the\n",
      "atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather.\n",
      "Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed:\n",
      "one may guess the power of the north wind, blowing over the edge, by\n",
      "the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and\n",
      "by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if\n",
      "craving alms of the sun. Happily, the architect had foresight to build\n",
      "it strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the\n",
      "corners defended with large jutting stones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of\n",
      "grotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about the\n",
      "principal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins\n",
      "and shameless little boys, I detected the date “1500,” and the name\n",
      "“Hareton Earnshaw.” I would have made a few comments, and requested a\n",
      "short history of the place from the surly owner; but his attitude at\n",
      "the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure,\n",
      "and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting\n",
      "the penetralium.\n",
      "\n",
      "One step brought us into the family sitting-room, without any\n",
      "introductory lobby or passage: they call it here “the house”\n",
      "pre-eminently. It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I\n",
      "believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat\n",
      "altogether into another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of\n",
      "tongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I\n",
      "observed no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge\n",
      "fireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on\n",
      "the walls. One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat\n",
      "from ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and\n",
      "tankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very\n",
      "roof. The latter had never been under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay\n",
      "bare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with\n",
      "oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it.\n",
      "Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of\n",
      "horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily painted canisters\n",
      "disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth, white stone; the\n",
      "chairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green: one or two\n",
      "heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser\n",
      "reposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of\n",
      "squealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as\n",
      "belonging to a homely, northern farmer, with a stubborn countenance,\n",
      "and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee-breeches and gaiters.\n",
      "Such an individual seated in his arm-chair, his mug of ale frothing on\n",
      "the round table before him, is to be seen in any circuit of five or six\n",
      "miles among these hills, if you go at the right time after dinner. But\n",
      "Mr. Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of\n",
      "living. He is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a\n",
      "gentleman: that is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire:\n",
      "rather slovenly, perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence,\n",
      "because he has an erect and handsome figure; and rather morose.\n",
      "Possibly, some people might suspect him of a degree of under-bred\n",
      "pride; I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of\n",
      "the sort: I know, by instinct, his reserve springs from an aversion to\n",
      "showy displays of feeling—to manifestations of mutual kindliness. He’ll\n",
      "love and hate equally under cover, and esteem it a species of\n",
      "impertinence to be loved or hated again. No, I’m running on too fast: I\n",
      "bestow my own attributes over-liberally on him. Mr. Heathcliff may have\n",
      "entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he\n",
      "meets a would-be acquaintance, to those which actuate me. Let me hope\n",
      "my constitution is almost peculiar: my dear mother used to say I should\n",
      "never have a comfortable home; and only last summer I proved myself\n",
      "perfectly unworthy of one.\n",
      "\n",
      "While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast, I was thrown\n",
      "into the company of a most fascinating creature: a real goddess in my\n",
      "eyes, as long as she took no notice of me. I “never told my love”\n",
      "vocally; still, if looks have language, the merest idiot might have\n",
      "guessed I was over head and ears: she understood me at last, and looked\n",
      "a return—the sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I\n",
      "confess it with shame—shrunk icily into myself, like a snail; at every\n",
      "glance retired colder and farther; till finally the poor innocent was\n",
      "led to doubt her own senses, and, overwhelmed with confusion at her\n",
      "supposed mistake, persuaded her mamma to decamp.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of\n",
      "deliberate heartlessness; how undeserved, I alone can appreciate.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which\n",
      "my landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of silence by\n",
      "attempting to caress the canine mother, who had left her nursery, and\n",
      "was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs, her lip curled up, and\n",
      "her white teeth watering for a snatch. My caress provoked a long,\n",
      "guttural gnarl.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’d better let the dog alone,” growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison,\n",
      "checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot. “She’s not\n",
      "accustomed to be spoiled—not kept for a pet.” Then, striding to a side\n",
      "door, he shouted again, “Joseph!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar, but gave no\n",
      "intimation of ascending; so his master dived down to him, leaving me\n",
      "_vis-à-vis_ the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep-dogs,\n",
      "who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not\n",
      "anxious to come in contact with their fangs, I sat still; but,\n",
      "imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortunately\n",
      "indulged in winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of my\n",
      "physiognomy so irritated madam, that she suddenly broke into a fury and\n",
      "leapt on my knees. I flung her back, and hastened to interpose the\n",
      "table between us. This proceeding aroused the whole hive: half-a-dozen\n",
      "four-footed fiends, of various sizes and ages, issued from hidden dens\n",
      "to the common centre. I felt my heels and coat-laps peculiar subjects\n",
      "of assault; and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I\n",
      "could with the poker, I was constrained to demand, aloud, assistance\n",
      "from some of the household in re-establishing peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious\n",
      "phlegm: I don’t think they moved one second faster than usual, though\n",
      "the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily, an\n",
      "inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch; a lusty dame, with\n",
      "tucked-up gown, bare arms, and fire-flushed cheeks, rushed into the\n",
      "midst of us flourishing a frying-pan: and used that weapon, and her\n",
      "tongue, to such purpose, that the storm subsided magically, and she\n",
      "only remained, heaving like a sea after a high wind, when her master\n",
      "entered on the scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What the devil is the matter?” he asked, eyeing me in a manner that I\n",
      "could ill endure after this inhospitable treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What the devil, indeed!” I muttered. “The herd of possessed swine\n",
      "could have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours,\n",
      "sir. You might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They won’t meddle with persons who touch nothing,” he remarked,\n",
      "putting the bottle before me, and restoring the displaced table. “The\n",
      "dogs do right to be vigilant. Take a glass of wine?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, thank you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not bitten, are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I had been, I would have set my signet on the biter.” Heathcliff’s\n",
      "countenance relaxed into a grin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, come,” he said, “you are flurried, Mr. Lockwood. Here, take a\n",
      "little wine. Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my\n",
      "dogs, I am willing to own, hardly know how to receive them. Your\n",
      "health, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I bowed and returned the pledge; beginning to perceive that it would be\n",
      "foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs; besides,\n",
      "I felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense; since\n",
      "his humour took that turn. He—probably swayed by prudential\n",
      "consideration of the folly of offending a good tenant—relaxed a little\n",
      "in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs,\n",
      "and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to me,—a\n",
      "discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of\n",
      "retirement. I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched; and\n",
      "before I went home, I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another\n",
      "visit to-morrow. He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion. I\n",
      "shall go, notwithstanding. It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself\n",
      "compared with him.\n",

      "CHAPTER II\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold. I had half a mind to spend\n",
      "it by my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to\n",
      "Wuthering Heights. On coming up from dinner, however, (N.B.—I dine\n",
      "between twelve and one o’clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken\n",
      "as a fixture along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend\n",
      "my request that I might be served at five)—on mounting the stairs with\n",
      "this lazy intention, and stepping into the room, I saw a servant-girl\n",
      "on her knees surrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an\n",
      "infernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders.\n",
      "This spectacle drove me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a\n",
      "four-miles’ walk, arrived at Heathcliff’s garden-gate just in time to\n",
      "escape the first feathery flakes of a snow shower.\n",
      "\n",
      "On that bleak hill top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the\n",
      "air made me shiver through every limb. Being unable to remove the\n",
      "chain, I jumped over, and, running up the flagged causeway bordered\n",
      "with straggling gooseberry-bushes, knocked vainly for admittance, till\n",
      "my knuckles tingled and the dogs howled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wretched inmates!” I ejaculated, mentally, “you deserve perpetual\n",
      "isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality. At least,\n",
      "I would not keep my doors barred in the day-time. I don’t care—I will\n",
      "get in!” So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it vehemently.\n",
      "Vinegar-faced Joseph projected his head from a round window of the\n",
      "barn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What are ye for?” he shouted. “T’ maister’s down i’ t’ fowld. Go round\n",
      "by th’ end o’ t’ laith, if ye went to spake to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there nobody inside to open the door?” I hallooed, responsively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s nobbut t’ missis; and shoo’ll not oppen ’t an ye mak’ yer\n",
      "flaysome dins till neeght.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why? Cannot you tell her whom I am, eh, Joseph?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor-ne me! I’ll hae no hend wi’t,” muttered the head, vanishing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The snow began to drive thickly. I seized the handle to essay another\n",
      "trial; when a young man without coat, and shouldering a pitchfork,\n",
      "appeared in the yard behind. He hailed me to follow him, and, after\n",
      "marching through a wash-house, and a paved area containing a coal-shed,\n",
      "pump, and pigeon-cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful\n",
      "apartment where I was formerly received. It glowed delightfully in the\n",
      "radiance of an immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and wood; and\n",
      "near the table, laid for a plentiful evening meal, I was pleased to\n",
      "observe the “missis,” an individual whose existence I had never\n",
      "previously suspected. I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me\n",
      "take a seat. She looked at me, leaning back in her chair, and remained\n",
      "motionless and mute.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rough weather!” I remarked. “I’m afraid, Mrs. Heathcliff, the door\n",
      "must bear the consequence of your servants’ leisure attendance: I had\n",
      "hard work to make them hear me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She never opened her mouth. I stared—she stared also: at any rate, she\n",
      "kept her eyes on me in a cool, regardless manner, exceedingly\n",
      "embarrassing and disagreeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sit down,” said the young man, gruffly. “He’ll be in soon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who deigned, at this\n",
      "second interview, to move the extreme tip of her tail, in token of\n",
      "owning my acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A beautiful animal!” I commenced again. “Do you intend parting with\n",
      "the little ones, madam?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are not mine,” said the amiable hostess, more repellingly than\n",
      "Heathcliff himself could have replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, your favourites are among these?” I continued, turning to an\n",
      "obscure cushion full of something like cats.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A strange choice of favourites!” she observed scornfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits. I hemmed once more, and drew\n",
      "closer to the hearth, repeating my comment on the wildness of the\n",
      "evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You should not have come out,” she said, rising and reaching from the\n",
      "chimney-piece two of the painted canisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a distinct\n",
      "view of her whole figure and countenance. She was slender, and\n",
      "apparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable form, and the most\n",
      "exquisite little face that I have ever had the pleasure of beholding;\n",
      "small features, very fair; flaxen ringlets, or rather golden, hanging\n",
      "loose on her delicate neck; and eyes, had they been agreeable in\n",
      "expression, that would have been irresistible: fortunately for my\n",
      "susceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between\n",
      "scorn and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected\n",
      "there. The canisters were almost out of her reach; I made a motion to\n",
      "aid her; she turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted\n",
      "to assist him in counting his gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t want your help,” she snapped; “I can get them for myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I beg your pardon!” I hastened to reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Were you asked to tea?” she demanded, tying an apron over her neat\n",
      "black frock, and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the\n",
      "pot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall be glad to have a cup,” I answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Were you asked?” she repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” I said, half smiling. “You are the proper person to ask me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her chair in a pet;\n",
      "her forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip pushed out, like a\n",
      "child’s ready to cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby\n",
      "upper garment, and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked down on\n",
      "me from the corner of his eyes, for all the world as if there were some\n",
      "mortal feud unavenged between us. I began to doubt whether he were a\n",
      "servant or not: his dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of\n",
      "the superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick brown\n",
      "curls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached bearishly\n",
      "over his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like those of a common\n",
      "labourer: still his bearing was free, almost haughty, and he showed\n",
      "none of a domestic’s assiduity in attending on the lady of the house.\n",
      "In the absence of clear proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to\n",
      "abstain from noticing his curious conduct; and, five minutes\n",
      "afterwards, the entrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure,\n",

      "you can afford me shelter during that space.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Half an hour?” he said, shaking the white flakes from his clothes; “I\n",
      "wonder you should select the thick of a snow-storm to ramble about in.\n",
      "Do you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes? People\n",
      "familiar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings; and I\n",
      "can tell you there is no chance of a change at present.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps I can get a guide among your lads, and he might stay at the\n",

      "“Is _he_ to have any?” she asked, appealing to Heathcliff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Get it ready, will you?” was the answer, uttered so savagely that I\n",
      "started. The tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad\n",
      "nature. I no longer felt inclined to call Heathcliff a capital fellow.\n",
      "When the preparations were finished, he invited me with—“Now, sir,\n",
      "bring forward your chair.” And we all, including the rustic youth, drew\n",

      "meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was my duty to make an effort\n",
      "to dispel it. They could not every day sit so grim and taciturn; and it\n",
      "was impossible, however ill-tempered they might be, that the universal\n",
      "scowl they wore was their every-day countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is strange,” I began, in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea\n",
      "and receiving another—“it is strange how custom can mould our tastes\n",
      "and ideas: many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life\n",
      "of such complete exile from the world as you spend, Mr. Heathcliff;\n",
      "yet, I’ll venture to say, that, surrounded by your family, and with\n",
      "your amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My amiable lady!” he interrupted, with an almost diabolical sneer on\n",
      "his face. “Where is she—my amiable lady?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Heathcliff, your wife, I mean.”\n",

      "when her body is gone. Is that it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Perceiving myself in a blunder, I attempted to correct it. I might have\n",
      "seen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to\n",
      "make it likely that they were man and wife. One was about forty: a\n",
      "period of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of\n",
      "being married for love by girls: that dream is reserved for the solace\n",
      "of our declining years. The other did not look seventeen.\n",

      "husband: Heathcliff junior, of course. Here is the consequence of being\n",
      "buried alive: she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer\n",
      "ignorance that better individuals existed! A sad pity—I must beware how\n",
      "I cause her to regret her choice.” The last reflection may seem\n",
      "conceited; it was not. My neighbour struck me as bordering on\n",
      "repulsive; I knew, through experience, that I was tolerably attractive.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law,” said Heathcliff, corroborating\n",
      "my surmise. He turned, as he spoke, a peculiar look in her direction: a\n",
      "look of hatred; unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles\n",
      "that will not, like those of other people, interpret the language of\n",
      "his soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, certainly—I see now: you are the favoured possessor of the\n",
      "beneficent fairy,” I remarked, turning to my neighbour.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was worse than before: the youth grew crimson, and clenched his\n",
      "fist, with every appearance of a meditated assault. But he seemed to\n",
      "recollect himself presently, and smothered the storm in a brutal curse,\n",
      "muttered on my behalf: which, however, I took care not to notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Unhappy in your conjectures, sir,” observed my host; “we neither of us\n",
      "have the privilege of owning your good fairy; her mate is dead. I said\n",
      "she was my daughter-in-law: therefore, she must have married my son.”\n",

      "“And this young man is—”\n",
      "\n",

      "“I’ve shown no disrespect,” was my reply, laughing internally at the\n",
      "dignity with which he announced himself.\n",

      "He fixed his eye on me longer than I cared to return the stare, for\n",
      "fear I might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity\n",
      "audible. I began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant\n",
      "family circle. The dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame, and more than\n",
      "neutralised, the glowing physical comforts round me; and I resolved to\n",
      "be cautious how I ventured under those rafters a third time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The business of eating being concluded, and no one uttering a word of\n",
      "sociable conversation, I approached a window to examine the weather. A\n",
      "sorrowful sight I saw: dark night coming down prematurely, and sky and\n",
      "hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think it possible for me to get home now without a guide,” I\n",

      "“Hareton, drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch. They’ll be\n",
      "covered if left in the fold all night: and put a plank before them,”\n",

      "\n",
      "“How must I do?” I continued, with rising irritation.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no reply to my question; and on looking round I saw only\n",
      "Joseph bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs, and Mrs. Heathcliff\n",
      "leaning over the fire, diverting herself with burning a bundle of\n",
      "matches which had fallen from the chimney-piece as she restored the\n",
      "tea-canister to its place. The former, when he had deposited his\n",
      "burden, took a critical survey of the room, and in cracked tones grated\n",
      "out—“Aw wonder how yah can faishion to stand thear i’ idleness un war,\n",

      "“You scandalous old hypocrite!” she replied. “Are you not afraid of\n",

      "ejaculating “wicked” as he went. I thought her conduct must be prompted\n",
      "by a species of dreary fun; and, now that we were alone, I endeavoured\n",
      "to interest her in my distress.\n",
      "\n",

      "bearing me down, and extinguishing the light; while a mingled guffaw\n",
      "from Heathcliff and Hareton put the copestone on my rage and\n",
      "humiliation. Fortunately, the beasts seemed more bent on stretching\n",
      "their paws, and yawning, and flourishing their tails, than devouring me\n",
      "alive; but they would suffer no resurrection, and I was forced to lie\n",
      "till their malignant masters pleased to deliver me: then, hatless and\n",

      "what would have concluded the scene, had there not been one person at\n",
      "hand rather more rational than myself, and more benevolent than my\n",
      "entertainer. This was Zillah, the stout housewife; who at length issued\n",
      "forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar. She thought that some\n",

      "the chamber she would put me in, and never let anybody lodge there\n",
      "willingly. I asked the reason. She did not know, she answered: she had\n",

      "she could not begin to be curious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Too stupefied to be curious myself, I fastened my door and glanced\n",

      "clothes-press, and a large oak case, with squares cut out near the top\n",
      "resembling coach windows. Having approached this structure, I looked\n",
      "inside, and perceived it to be a singular sort of old-fashioned couch,\n",
      "very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of\n",

      "absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own\n",

      "text—“Seventy Times Seven;” and either Joseph, the preacher, or I had\n",

      "near a swamp, whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes\n",
      "of embalming on the few corpses deposited there. The roof has been kept\n",
      "whole hitherto; but as the clergyman’s stipend is only twenty pounds\n",
      "per annum, and a house with two rooms, threatening speedily to\n",
      "determine into one, no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor:\n",
      "especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let\n",
      "him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own\n",
      "pockets. However, in my dream, Jabez had a full and attentive\n",
      "congregation; and he preached—good God! what a sermon; divided into\n",
      "_four hundred and ninety_ parts, each fully equal to an ordinary\n",
      "address from the pulpit, and each discussing a separate sin! Where he\n",
      "searched for them, I cannot tell. He had his private manner of\n",
      "interpreting the phrase, and it seemed necessary the brother should sin\n",

      "would _ever_ have done. I was condemned to hear all out: finally, he\n",

      "“Sir,” I exclaimed, “sitting here within these four walls, at one\n",

      "and been about to depart—Seventy times seven times have you\n",

      "several clubs crossed; blows, aimed at me, fell on other sconces.\n",
      "Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter\n",
      "rappings: every man’s hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham,\n",

      "last, to my unspeakable relief, they woke me. And what was it that had\n",
      "suggested the tremendous tumult? What had played Jabez’s part in the\n",

      "the fir bough repeat its teasing sound, and ascribed it to the right\n",
      "cause: but it annoyed me so much, that I resolved to silence it, if\n",
      "possible; and, I thought, I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the\n",
      "casement. The hook was soldered into the staple: a circumstance\n",
      "observed by me when awake, but forgotten. “I must stop it,\n",
      "nevertheless!” I muttered, knocking my knuckles through the glass, and\n",
      "stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch; instead of\n",
      "which, my fingers closed on the fingers of a little, ice-cold hand!\n",

      "rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes:\n",

      "approached my chamber door; somebody pushed it open, with a vigorous\n",
      "hand, and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed.\n",
      "I sat shuddering, yet, and wiping the perspiration from my forehead:\n",

      "candle dripping over his fingers, and his face as white as the wall\n",
      "behind him. The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric\n",
      "shock: the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet, and\n",
      "his agitation was so extreme, that he could hardly pick it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is only your guest, sir,” I called out, desirous to spare him the\n",
      "humiliation of exposing his cowardice further. “I had the misfortune to\n",

      "disturbed you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, God confound you, Mr. Lockwood! I wish you were at the—” commenced\n",

      "to hold it steady. “And who showed you up into this room?” he\n",
      "continued, crushing his nails into his palms, and grinding his teeth to\n",
      "subdue the maxillary convulsions. “Who was it? I’ve a good mind to turn\n",
      "them out of the house this moment!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was your servant Zillah,” I replied, flinging myself on to the\n",
      "floor, and rapidly resuming my garments. “I should not care if you did,\n",

      "get another proof that the place was haunted, at my expense. Well, it\n",
      "is—swarming with ghosts and goblins! You have reason in shutting it up,\n",
      "I assure you. No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean?” asked Heathcliff, “and what are you doing? Lie down\n",
      "and finish out the night, since you _are_ here; but, for Heaven’s sake!\n",
      "don’t repeat that horrid noise: nothing could excuse it, unless you\n",
      "were having your throat cut!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If the little fiend had got in at the window, she probably would have\n",

      "akin to you on the mother’s side? And that minx, Catherine Linton, or\n",
      "Earnshaw, or however she was called—she must have been a\n",

      "inconsideration: but, without showing further consciousness of the\n",
      "offence, I hastened to add—“The truth is, sir, I passed the first part\n",
      "of the night in—” Here I stopped afresh—I was about to say “perusing\n",

      "written, as well as their printed, contents; so, correcting myself, I\n",
      "went on—“in spelling over the name scratched on that window-ledge. A\n",
      "monotonous occupation, calculated to set me asleep, like counting, or—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What _can_ you mean by talking in this way to _me!_” thundered\n",
      "Heathcliff with savage vehemence. “How—how _dare_ you, under my\n",
      "roof?—God! he’s mad to speak so!” And he struck his forehead with rage.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my\n",
      "explanation; but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and\n",
      "proceeded with my dreams; affirming I had never heard the appellation\n",
      "of “Catherine Linton” before, but reading it often over produced an\n",
      "impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination\n",
      "under control. Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the\n",
      "bed, as I spoke; finally sitting down almost concealed behind it. I\n",
      "guessed, however, by his irregular and intercepted breathing, that he\n",
      "struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion. Not liking to show\n",
      "him that I had heard the conflict, I continued my toilette rather\n",
      "noisily, looked at my watch, and soliloquised on the length of the\n",
      "night: “Not three o’clock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six.\n",
      "Time stagnates here: we must surely have retired to rest at eight!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Always at nine in winter, and rise at four,” said my host, suppressing\n",
      "a groan: and, as I fancied, by the motion of his arm’s shadow, dashing\n",
      "a tear from his eyes. “Mr. Lockwood,” he added, “you may go into my\n",
      "room: you’ll only be in the way, coming downstairs so early: and your\n",
      "childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.”\n",
      "\n",

      "then I’ll be off; and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion.\n",
      "I’m now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or\n",
      "town. A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Delightful company!” muttered Heathcliff. “Take the candle, and go\n",
      "where you please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of the yard,\n",
      "though, the dogs are unchained; and the house—Juno mounts sentinel\n",
      "there, and—nay, you can only ramble about the steps and passages. But,\n",
      "away with you! I’ll come in two minutes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I obeyed, so far as to quit the chamber; when, ignorant where the\n",
      "narrow lobbies led, I stood still, and was witness, involuntarily, to a\n",
      "piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied, oddly,\n",
      "his apparent sense. He got on to the bed, and wrenched open the\n",
      "lattice, bursting, as he pulled at it, into an uncontrollable passion\n",
      "of tears. “Come in! come in!” he sobbed. “Cathy, do come. Oh, do—_once_\n",

      "There was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied this\n",
      "raving, that my compassion made me overlook its folly, and I drew off,\n",
      "half angry to have listened at all, and vexed at having related my\n",
      "ridiculous nightmare, since it produced that agony; though _why_ was\n",
      "beyond my comprehension. I descended cautiously to the lower regions,\n",
      "and landed in the back-kitchen, where a gleam of fire, raked compactly\n",
      "together, enabled me to rekindle my candle. Nothing was stirring except\n",
      "a brindled, grey cat, which crept from the ashes, and saluted me with a\n",
      "querulous mew.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two benches, shaped in sections of a circle, nearly enclosed the\n",
      "hearth; on one of these I stretched myself, and Grimalkin mounted the\n",
      "other. We were both of us nodding ere any one invaded our retreat, and\n",
      "then it was Joseph, shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the\n",
      "roof, through a trap: the ascent to his garret, I suppose. He cast a\n",
      "sinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between\n",
      "the ribs, swept the cat from its elevation, and bestowing himself in\n",
      "the vacancy, commenced the operation of stuffing a three-inch pipe with\n",
      "tobacco. My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of\n",
      "impudence too shameful for remark: he silently applied the tube to his\n",
      "lips, folded his arms, and puffed away. I let him enjoy the luxury\n",
      "unannoyed; and after sucking out his last wreath, and heaving a\n",
      "profound sigh, he got up, and departed as solemnly as he came.\n",
      "\n",
      "A more elastic footstep entered next; and now I opened my mouth for a\n",
      "“good-morning,” but closed it again, the salutation unachieved; for\n",

      "curses directed against every object he touched, while he rummaged a\n",
      "corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts. He glanced over\n",
      "the back of the bench, dilating his nostrils, and thought as little of\n",
      "exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat. I guessed,\n",
      "by his preparations, that egress was allowed, and, leaving my hard\n",
      "couch, made a movement to follow him. He noticed this, and thrust at an\n",
      "inner door with the end of his spade, intimating by an inarticulate\n",

      "chide the servant for covering her with sparks, or to push away a dog,\n",

      "else attracted by hearing his voice, it crept to Mr. Earnshaw’s door,\n",

      "who died in childhood, and it has served him ever since, both for\n",
      "Christian and surname. Miss Cathy and he were now very thick; but\n",
      "Hindley hated him: and to say the truth I did the same; and we plagued\n",
      "and went on with him shamefully: for I wasn’t reasonable enough to feel\n",
      "my injustice, and the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when\n",

      "He seemed a sullen, patient child; hardened, perhaps, to ill-treatment:\n",
      "he would stand Hindley’s blows without winking or shedding a tear, and\n",
      "my pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes, as if\n",
      "he had hurt himself by accident, and nobody was to blame. This\n",
      "endurance made old Earnshaw furious, when he discovered his son\n",

      "Heathcliff strangely, believing all he said (for that matter, he said\n",
      "precious little, and generally the truth), and petting him up far above\n",
      "Cathy, who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, from the very beginning, he bred bad feeling in the house; and at\n",
      "Mrs. Earnshaw’s death, which happened in less than two years after, the\n",
      "young master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather\n",
      "than a friend, and Heathcliff as a usurper of his parent’s affections\n",
      "and his privileges; and he grew bitter with brooding over these\n",
      "injuries. I sympathised a while; but when the children fell ill of the\n",
      "measles, and I had to tend them, and take on me the cares of a woman at\n",
      "once, I changed my idea. Heathcliff was dangerously sick; and while he\n",
      "lay at the worst he would have me constantly by his pillow: I suppose\n",
      "he felt I did a good deal for him, and he hadn’t wit to guess that I\n",
      "was compelled to do it. However, I will say this, he was the quietest\n",
      "child that ever nurse watched over. The difference between him and the\n",
      "others forced me to be less partial. Cathy and her brother harassed me\n",
      "terribly: _he_ was as uncomplaining as a lamb; though hardness, not\n",
      "gentleness, made him give little trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "He got through, and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing\n",
      "to me, and praised me for my care. I was vain of his commendations, and\n",
      "softened towards the being by whose means I earned them, and thus\n",
      "Hindley lost his last ally: still I couldn’t dote on Heathcliff, and I\n",
      "wondered often what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy;\n",
      "who never, to my recollection, repaid his indulgence by any sign of\n",
      "gratitude. He was not insolent to his benefactor, he was simply\n",
      "insensible; though knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart, and\n",
      "conscious he had only to speak and all the house would be obliged to\n",
      "bend to his wishes. As an instance, I remember Mr. Earnshaw once bought\n",
      "a couple of colts at the parish fair, and gave the lads each one.\n",
      "Heathcliff took the handsomest, but it soon fell lame, and when he\n",
      "discovered it, he said to Hindley—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must exchange horses with me: I don’t like mine; and if you won’t\n",
      "I shall tell your father of the three thrashings you’ve given me this\n",
      "week, and show him my arm, which is black to the shoulder.” Hindley put\n",
      "out his tongue, and cuffed him over the ears. “You’d better do it at\n",
      "once,” he persisted, escaping to the porch (they were in the stable):\n",
      "“you will have to: and if I speak of these blows, you’ll get them again\n",
      "with interest.” “Off, dog!” cried Hindley, threatening him with an iron\n",
      "weight used for weighing potatoes and hay. “Throw it,” he replied,\n",
      "standing still, “and then I’ll tell how you boasted that you would turn\n",
      "me out of doors as soon as he died, and see whether he will not turn\n",
      "you out directly.” Hindley threw it, hitting him on the breast, and\n",
      "down he fell, but staggered up immediately, breathless and white; and,\n",
      "had not I prevented it, he would have gone just so to the master, and\n",
      "got full revenge by letting his condition plead for him, intimating who\n",
      "had caused it. “Take my colt, Gipsy, then!” said young Earnshaw. “And I\n",

      "intention; exchanging saddles and all, and then sitting down on a\n",
      "bundle of hay to overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned,\n",

      "partiality; and that humouring was rich nourishment to the child’s\n",
      "pride and black tempers. Still it became in a manner necessary; twice,\n",
      "or thrice, Hindley’s manifestation of scorn, while his father was near,\n",
      "roused the old man to a fury: he seized his stick to strike him, and\n",
      "shook with rage that he could not do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, our curate (we had a curate then who made the living answer by\n",
      "teaching the little Lintons and Earnshaws, and farming his bit of land\n",
      "himself) advised that the young man should be sent to college; and Mr.\n",
      "Earnshaw agreed, though with a heavy spirit, for he said—“Hindley was\n",
      "nought, and would never thrive as where he wandered.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I hoped heartily we should have peace now. It hurt me to think the\n",
      "master should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed. I fancied the\n",
      "discontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements; as\n",
      "he would have it that it did: really, you know, sir, it was in his\n",
      "sinking frame. We might have got on tolerably, notwithstanding, but for\n",
      "two people—Miss Cathy, and Joseph, the servant: you saw him, I daresay,\n",
      "up yonder. He was, and is yet most likely, the wearisomest\n",
      "self-righteous Pharisee that ever ransacked a Bible to rake the\n",
      "promises to himself and fling the curses to his neighbours. By his\n",
      "knack of sermonising and pious discoursing, he contrived to make a\n",
      "great impression on Mr. Earnshaw; and the more feeble the master\n",
      "became, the more influence he gained. He was relentless in worrying him\n",
      "about his soul’s concerns, and about ruling his children rigidly. He\n",
      "encouraged him to regard Hindley as a reprobate; and, night after\n",
      "night, he regularly grumbled out a long string of tales against\n",
      "Heathcliff and Catherine: always minding to flatter Earnshaw’s weakness\n",
      "by heaping the heaviest blame on the latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly she had ways with her such as I never saw a child take up\n",
      "before; and she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener\n",
      "in a day: from the hour she came downstairs till the hour she went to\n",
      "bed, we had not a minute’s security that she wouldn’t be in mischief.\n",
      "Her spirits were always at high-water mark, her tongue always\n",
      "going—singing, laughing, and plaguing everybody who would not do the\n",
      "same. A wild, wicked slip she was—but she had the bonniest eye, the\n",
      "sweetest smile, and lightest foot in the parish: and, after all, I\n",
      "believe she meant no harm; for when once she made you cry in good\n",
      "earnest, it seldom happened that she would not keep you company, and\n",
      "oblige you to be quiet that you might comfort her. She was much too\n",
      "fond of Heathcliff. The greatest punishment we could invent for her was\n",
      "to keep her separate from him: yet she got chided more than any of us\n",
      "on his account. In play, she liked exceedingly to act the little\n",
      "mistress; using her hands freely, and commanding her companions: she\n",
      "did so to me, but I would not bear slapping and ordering; and so I let\n",
      "her know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Mr. Earnshaw did not understand jokes from his children: he had\n",
      "always been strict and grave with them; and Catherine, on her part, had\n",
      "no idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in his ailing\n",
      "condition than he was in his prime. His peevish reproofs wakened in her\n",
      "a naughty delight to provoke him: she was never so happy as when we\n",
      "were all scolding her at once, and she defying us with her bold, saucy\n",
      "look, and her ready words; turning Joseph’s religious curses into\n",
      "ridicule, baiting me, and doing just what her father hated most—showing\n",
      "how her pretended insolence, which he thought real, had more power over\n",
      "Heathcliff than his kindness: how the boy would do _her_ bidding in\n",
      "anything, and _his_ only when it suited his own inclination. After\n",
      "behaving as badly as possible all day, she sometimes came fondling to\n",
      "make it up at night. “Nay, Cathy,” the old man would say, “I cannot\n",
      "love thee, thou’rt worse than thy brother. Go, say thy prayers, child,\n",
      "and ask God’s pardon. I doubt thy mother and I must rue that we ever\n",
      "reared thee!” That made her cry, at first; and then being repulsed\n",
      "continually hardened her, and she laughed if I told her to say she was\n",
      "sorry for her faults, and beg to be forgiven.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the hour came, at last, that ended Mr. Earnshaw’s troubles on\n",
      "earth. He died quietly in his chair one October evening, seated by the\n",
      "fire-side. A high wind blustered round the house, and roared in the\n",
      "chimney: it sounded wild and stormy, yet it was not cold, and we were\n",
      "all together—I, a little removed from the hearth, busy at my knitting,\n",
      "and Joseph reading his Bible near the table (for the servants generally\n",
      "sat in the house then, after their work was done). Miss Cathy had been\n",
      "sick, and that made her still; she leant against her father’s knee, and\n",
      "Heathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap. I remember\n",
      "the master, before he fell into a doze, stroking her bonny hair—it\n",
      "pleased him rarely to see her gentle—and saying, “Why canst thou not\n",
      "always be a good lass, Cathy?” And she turned her face up to his, and\n",
      "laughed, and answered, “Why cannot you always be a good man, father?”\n",
      "But as soon as she saw him vexed again, she kissed his hand, and said\n",
      "she would sing him to sleep. She began singing very low, till his\n",
      "fingers dropped from hers, and his head sank on his breast. Then I told\n",
      "her to hush, and not stir, for fear she should wake him. We all kept as\n",
      "mute as mice a full half-hour, and should have done so longer, only\n",
      "Joseph, having finished his chapter, got up and said that he must rouse\n",
      "the master for prayers and bed. He stepped forward, and called him by\n",
      "name, and touched his shoulder; but he would not move: so he took the\n",
      "candle and looked at him. I thought there was something wrong as he set\n",
      "down the light; and seizing the children each by an arm, whispered them\n",
      "to “frame upstairs, and make little din—they might pray alone that\n",
      "evening—he had summut to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall bid father good-night first,” said Catherine, putting her arms\n",
      "round his neck, before we could hinder her. The poor thing discovered\n",
      "her loss directly—she screamed out—“Oh, he’s dead, Heathcliff! he’s\n",
      "dead!” And they both set up a heart-breaking cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "I joined my wail to theirs, loud and bitter; but Joseph asked what we\n",
      "could be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven. He\n",
      "told me to put on my cloak and run to Gimmerton for the doctor and the\n",
      "parson. I could not guess the use that either would be of, then.\n",
      "However, I went, through wind and rain, and brought one, the doctor,\n",
      "back with me; the other said he would come in the morning. Leaving\n",
      "Joseph to explain matters, I ran to the children’s room: their door was\n",
      "ajar, I saw they had never lain down, though it was past midnight; but\n",
      "they were calmer, and did not need me to console them. The little souls\n",
      "were comforting each other with better thoughts than I could have hit\n",
      "on: no parson in the world ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they\n",
      "did, in their innocent talk; and, while I sobbed and listened, I could\n",
      "not help wishing we were all there safe together.\n",

      "Mr. Hindley came home to the funeral; and—a thing that amazed us, and\n",
      "set the neighbours gossiping right and left—he brought a wife with him.\n",
      "What she was, and where she was born, he never informed us: probably,\n",
      "she had neither money nor name to recommend her, or he would scarcely\n",
      "have kept the union from his father.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own\n",
      "account. Every object she saw, the moment she crossed the threshold,\n",
      "appeared to delight her; and every circumstance that took place about\n",
      "her: except the preparing for the burial, and the presence of the\n",
      "mourners. I thought she was half silly, from her behaviour while that\n",
      "went on: she ran into her chamber, and made me come with her, though I\n",
      "should have been dressing the children: and there she sat shivering and\n",
      "clasping her hands, and asking repeatedly—“Are they gone yet?” Then she\n",
      "began describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her\n",
      "to see black; and started, and trembled, and, at last, fell\n",
      "a-weeping—and when I asked what was the matter, answered, she didn’t\n",
      "know; but she felt so afraid of dying! I imagined her as little likely\n",
      "to die as myself. She was rather thin, but young, and\n",
      "fresh-complexioned, and her eyes sparkled as bright as diamonds. I did\n",
      "remark, to be sure, that mounting the stairs made her breathe very\n",
      "quick; that the least sudden noise set her all in a quiver, and that\n",
      "she coughed troublesomely sometimes: but I knew nothing of what these\n",
      "symptoms portended, and had no impulse to sympathise with her. We don’t\n",
      "in general take to foreigners here, Mr. Lockwood, unless they take to\n",
      "us first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Young Earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his\n",
      "absence. He had grown sparer, and lost his colour, and spoke and\n",
      "dressed quite differently; and, on the very day of his return, he told\n",
      "Joseph and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the\n",
      "back-kitchen, and leave the house for him. Indeed, he would have\n",
      "carpeted and papered a small spare room for a parlour; but his wife\n",
      "expressed such pleasure at the white floor and huge glowing fireplace,\n",
      "at the pewter dishes and delf-case, and dog-kennel, and the wide space\n",
      "there was to move about in where they usually sat, that he thought it\n",
      "unnecessary to her comfort, and so dropped the intention.\n",
      "\n",
      "She expressed pleasure, too, at finding a sister among her new\n",
      "acquaintance; and she prattled to Catherine, and kissed her, and ran\n",
      "about with her, and gave her quantities of presents, at the beginning.\n",
      "Her affection tired very soon, however, and when she grew peevish,\n",
      "Hindley became tyrannical. A few words from her, evincing a dislike to\n",
      "Heathcliff, were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy.\n",
      "He drove him from their company to the servants, deprived him of the\n",
      "instructions of the curate, and insisted that he should labour out of\n",
      "doors instead; compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the\n",
      "farm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first, because Cathy\n",
      "taught him what she learnt, and worked or played with him in the\n",
      "fields. They both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages; the\n",
      "young master being entirely negligent how they behaved, and what they\n",
      "did, so they kept clear of him. He would not even have seen after their\n",
      "going to church on Sundays, only Joseph and the curate reprimanded his\n",
      "carelessness when they absented themselves; and that reminded him to\n",
      "order Heathcliff a flogging, and Catherine a fast from dinner or\n",
      "supper. But it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the\n",
      "moors in the morning and remain there all day, and the after punishment\n",
      "grew a mere thing to laugh at. The curate might set as many chapters as\n",
      "he pleased for Catherine to get by heart, and Joseph might thrash\n",
      "Heathcliff till his arm ached; they forgot everything the minute they\n",
      "were together again: at least the minute they had contrived some\n",
      "naughty plan of revenge; and many a time I’ve cried to myself to watch\n",
      "them growing more reckless daily, and I not daring to speak a syllable,\n",
      "for fear of losing the small power I still retained over the unfriended\n",
      "creatures. One Sunday evening, it chanced that they were banished from\n",
      "the sitting-room, for making a noise, or a light offence of the kind;\n",
      "and when I went to call them to supper, I could discover them nowhere.\n",
      "We searched the house, above and below, and the yard and stables; they\n",
      "were invisible: and, at last, Hindley in a passion told us to bolt the\n",
      "doors, and swore nobody should let them in that night. The household\n",
      "went to bed; and I, too anxious to lie down, opened my lattice and put\n",
      "my head out to hearken, though it rained: determined to admit them in\n",
      "spite of the prohibition, should they return. In a while, I\n",
      "distinguished steps coming up the road, and the light of a lantern\n",
      "glimmered through the gate. I threw a shawl over my head and ran to\n",
      "prevent them from waking Mr. Earnshaw by knocking. There was\n",
      "Heathcliff, by himself: it gave me a start to see him alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is Miss Catherine?” I cried hurriedly. “No accident, I hope?”\n",
      "“At Thrushcross Grange,” he answered; “and I would have been there too,\n",
      "but they had not the manners to ask me to stay.” “Well, you will catch\n",
      "it!” I said: “you’ll never be content till you’re sent about your\n",
      "business. What in the world led you wandering to Thrushcross Grange?”\n",
      "“Let me get off my wet clothes, and I’ll tell you all about it, Nelly,”\n",
      "he replied. I bid him beware of rousing the master, and while he\n",
      "undressed and I waited to put out the candle, he continued—“Cathy and I\n",
      "escaped from the wash-house to have a ramble at liberty, and getting a\n",
      "glimpse of the Grange lights, we thought we would just go and see\n",
      "whether the Lintons passed their Sunday evenings standing shivering in\n",
      "corners, while their father and mother sat eating and drinking, and\n",
      "singing and laughing, and burning their eyes out before the fire. Do\n",
      "you think they do? Or reading sermons, and being catechised by their\n",
      "man-servant, and set to learn a column of Scripture names, if they\n",
      "don’t answer properly?” “Probably not,” I responded. “They are good\n",
      "children, no doubt, and don’t deserve the treatment you receive, for\n",
      "your bad conduct.” “Don’t cant, Nelly,” he said: “nonsense! We ran from\n",
      "the top of the Heights to the park, without stopping—Catherine\n",
      "completely beaten in the race, because she was barefoot. You’ll have to\n",
      "seek for her shoes in the bog to-morrow. We crept through a broken\n",
      "hedge, groped our way up the path, and planted ourselves on a\n",
      "flower-plot under the drawing-room window. The light came from thence;\n",
      "they had not put up the shutters, and the curtains were only half\n",
      "closed. Both of us were able to look in by standing on the basement,\n",
      "and clinging to the ledge, and we saw—ah! it was beautiful—a splendid\n",
      "place carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs and tables, and\n",
      "a pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of glass-drops hanging\n",
      "in silver chains from the centre, and shimmering with little soft\n",
      "tapers. Old Mr. and Mrs. Linton were not there; Edgar and his sister\n",
      "had it entirely to themselves. Shouldn’t they have been happy? We\n",
      "should have thought ourselves in heaven! And now, guess what your good\n",
      "children were doing? Isabella—I believe she is eleven, a year younger\n",
      "than Cathy—lay screaming at the farther end of the room, shrieking as\n",
      "if witches were running red-hot needles into her. Edgar stood on the\n",
      "hearth weeping silently, and in the middle of the table sat a little\n",
      "dog, shaking its paw and yelping; which, from their mutual accusations,\n",
      "we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them. The idiots!\n",
      "That was their pleasure! to quarrel who should hold a heap of warm\n",
      "hair, and each begin to cry because both, after struggling to get it,\n",
      "refused to take it. We laughed outright at the petted things; we did\n",
      "despise them! When would you catch me wishing to have what Catherine\n",
      "wanted? or find us by ourselves, seeking entertainment in yelling, and\n",
      "sobbing, and rolling on the ground, divided by the whole room? I’d not\n",
      "exchange, for a thousand lives, my condition here, for Edgar Linton’s\n",
      "at Thrushcross Grange—not if I might have the privilege of flinging\n",
      "Joseph off the highest gable, and painting the house-front with\n",
      "Hindley’s blood!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush, hush!” I interrupted. “Still you have not told me, Heathcliff,\n",
      "how Catherine is left behind?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I told you we laughed,” he answered. “The Lintons heard us, and with\n",
      "one accord they shot like arrows to the door; there was silence, and\n",
      "then a cry, ‘Oh, mamma, mamma! Oh, papa! Oh, mamma, come here. Oh,\n",
      "papa, oh!’ They really did howl out something in that way. We made\n",
      "frightful noises to terrify them still more, and then we dropped off\n",
      "the ledge, because somebody was drawing the bars, and we felt we had\n",
      "better flee. I had Cathy by the hand, and was urging her on, when all\n",
      "at once she fell down. ‘Run, Heathcliff, run!’ she whispered. ‘They\n",
      "have let the bull-dog loose, and he holds me!’ The devil had seized her\n",
      "ankle, Nelly: I heard his abominable snorting. She did not yell out—no!\n",
      "she would have scorned to do it, if she had been spitted on the horns\n",
      "of a mad cow. I did, though: I vociferated curses enough to annihilate\n",
      "any fiend in Christendom; and I got a stone and thrust it between his\n",
      "jaws, and tried with all my might to cram it down his throat. A beast\n",
      "of a servant came up with a lantern, at last, shouting—‘Keep fast,\n",
      "Skulker, keep fast!’ He changed his note, however, when he saw\n",
      "Skulker’s game. The dog was throttled off; his huge, purple tongue\n",
      "hanging half a foot out of his mouth, and his pendent lips streaming\n",
      "with bloody slaver. The man took Cathy up; she was sick: not from fear,\n",
      "I’m certain, but from pain. He carried her in; I followed, grumbling\n",
      "execrations and vengeance. ‘What prey, Robert?’ hallooed Linton from\n",
      "the entrance. ‘Skulker has caught a little girl, sir,’ he replied; ‘and\n",
      "there’s a lad here,’ he added, making a clutch at me, ‘who looks an\n",
      "out-and-outer! Very like the robbers were for putting them through the\n",
      "window to open the doors to the gang after all were asleep, that they\n",
      "might murder us at their ease. Hold your tongue, you foul-mouthed\n",
      "thief, you! you shall go to the gallows for this. Mr. Linton, sir,\n",
      "don’t lay by your gun.’ ‘No, no, Robert,’ said the old fool. ‘The\n",
      "rascals knew that yesterday was my rent-day: they thought to have me\n",
      "cleverly. Come in; I’ll furnish them a reception. There, John, fasten\n",
      "the chain. Give Skulker some water, Jenny. To beard a magistrate in his\n",
      "stronghold, and on the Sabbath, too! Where will their insolence stop?\n",
      "Oh, my dear Mary, look here! Don’t be afraid, it is but a boy—yet the\n",
      "villain scowls so plainly in his face; would it not be a kindness to\n",
      "the country to hang him at once, before he shows his nature in acts as\n",
      "well as features?’ He pulled me under the chandelier, and Mrs. Linton\n",
      "placed her spectacles on her nose and raised her hands in horror. The\n",
      "cowardly children crept nearer also, Isabella lisping—‘Frightful thing!\n",
      "Put him in the cellar, papa. He’s exactly like the son of the\n",
      "fortune-teller that stole my tame pheasant. Isn’t he, Edgar?’\n",
      "\n",
      "“While they examined me, Cathy came round; she heard the last speech,\n",
      "and laughed. Edgar Linton, after an inquisitive stare, collected\n",
      "sufficient wit to recognise her. They see us at church, you know,\n",
      "though we seldom meet them elsewhere. ‘That’s Miss Earnshaw!’ he\n",
      "whispered to his mother, ‘and look how Skulker has bitten her—how her\n",
      "foot bleeds!’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Miss Earnshaw? Nonsense!’ cried the dame; ‘Miss Earnshaw scouring the\n",
      "country with a gipsy! And yet, my dear, the child is in mourning—surely\n",
      "it is—and she may be lamed for life!’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘What culpable carelessness in her brother!’ exclaimed Mr. Linton,\n",
      "turning from me to Catherine. ‘I’ve understood from Shielders’” (that\n",
      "was the curate, sir) “‘that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism.\n",
      "But who is this? Where did she pick up this companion? Oho! I declare\n",
      "he is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made, in his journey\n",
      "to Liverpool—a little Lascar, or an American or Spanish castaway.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘A wicked boy, at all events,’ remarked the old lady, ‘and quite unfit\n",
      "for a decent house! Did you notice his language, Linton? I’m shocked\n",
      "that my children should have heard it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“I recommenced cursing—don’t be angry, Nelly—and so Robert was ordered\n",
      "to take me off. I refused to go without Cathy; he dragged me into the\n",
      "garden, pushed the lantern into my hand, assured me that Mr. Earnshaw\n",
      "should be informed of my behaviour, and, bidding me march directly,\n",
      "secured the door again. The curtains were still looped up at one\n",
      "corner, and I resumed my station as spy; because, if Catherine had\n",
      "wished to return, I intended shattering their great glass panes to a\n",
      "million of fragments, unless they let her out. She sat on the sofa\n",
      "quietly. Mrs. Linton took off the grey cloak of the dairy-maid which we\n",
      "had borrowed for our excursion, shaking her head and expostulating with\n",
      "her, I suppose: she was a young lady, and they made a distinction\n",
      "between her treatment and mine. Then the woman-servant brought a basin\n",
      "of warm water, and washed her feet; and Mr. Linton mixed a tumbler of\n",
      "negus, and Isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap, and Edgar\n",
      "stood gaping at a distance. Afterwards, they dried and combed her\n",
      "beautiful hair, and gave her a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled\n",
      "her to the fire; and I left her, as merry as she could be, dividing her\n",
      "food between the little dog and Skulker, whose nose she pinched as he\n",
      "ate; and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the\n",
      "Lintons—a dim reflection from her own enchanting face. I saw they were\n",
      "full of stupid admiration; she is so immeasurably superior to them—to\n",
      "everybody on earth, is she not, Nelly?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There will more come of this business than you reckon on,” I answered,\n",
      "covering him up and extinguishing the light. “You are incurable,\n",
      "Heathcliff; and Mr. Hindley will have to proceed to extremities, see if\n",
      "he won’t.” My words came truer than I desired. The luckless adventure\n",
      "made Earnshaw furious. And then Mr. Linton, to mend matters, paid us a\n",
      "visit himself on the morrow, and read the young master such a lecture\n",
      "on the road he guided his family, that he was stirred to look about\n",
      "him, in earnest. Heathcliff received no flogging, but he was told that\n",
      "the first word he spoke to Miss Catherine should ensure a dismissal;\n",
      "and Mrs. Earnshaw undertook to keep her sister-in-law in due restraint\n",
      "when she returned home; employing art, not force: with force she would\n",
      "have found it impossible.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks: till Christmas. By that\n",
      "time her ankle was thoroughly cured, and her manners much improved. The\n",
      "mistress visited her often in the interval, and commenced her plan of\n",
      "reform by trying to raise her self-respect with fine clothes and\n",
      "flattery, which she took readily; so that, instead of a wild, hatless\n",
      "little savage jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze us all\n",
      "breathless, there lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified\n",
      "person, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered\n",
      "beaver, and a long cloth habit, which she was obliged to hold up with\n",
      "both hands that she might sail in. Hindley lifted her from her horse,\n",
      "exclaiming delightedly, “Why, Cathy, you are quite a beauty! I should\n",
      "scarcely have known you: you look like a lady now. Isabella Linton is\n",
      "not to be compared with her, is she, Frances?” “Isabella has not her\n",
      "natural advantages,” replied his wife: “but she must mind and not grow\n",
      "wild again here. Ellen, help Miss Catherine off with her things—Stay,\n",
      "dear, you will disarrange your curls—let me untie your hat.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk\n",
      "frock, white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while her eyes\n",
      "sparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her, she\n",
      "dared hardly touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid\n",
      "garments. She kissed me gently: I was all flour making the Christmas\n",
      "cake, and it would not have done to give me a hug; and then she looked\n",
      "round for Heathcliff. Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously their\n",
      "meeting; thinking it would enable them to judge, in some measure, what\n",
      "grounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heathcliff was hard to discover, at first. If he were careless, and\n",
      "uncared for, before Catherine’s absence, he had been ten times more so\n",
      "since. Nobody but I even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy,\n",
      "and bid him wash himself, once a week; and children of his age seldom\n",
      "have a natural pleasure in soap and water. Therefore, not to mention\n",
      "his clothes, which had seen three months’ service in mire and dust, and\n",
      "his thick uncombed hair, the surface of his face and hands was dismally\n",
      "beclouded. He might well skulk behind the settle, on beholding such a\n",
      "bright, graceful damsel enter the house, instead of a rough-headed\n",
      "counterpart of himself, as he expected. “Is Heathcliff not here?” she\n",
      "demanded, pulling off her gloves, and displaying fingers wonderfully\n",
      "whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heathcliff, you may come forward,” cried Mr. Hindley, enjoying his\n",
      "discomfiture, and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard\n",
      "he would be compelled to present himself. “You may come and wish Miss\n",
      "Catherine welcome, like the other servants.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Cathy, catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment, flew to\n",
      "embrace him; she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the\n",
      "second, and then stopped, and drawing back, burst into a laugh,\n",
      "exclaiming, “Why, how very black and cross you look! and how—how funny\n",
      "and grim! But that’s because I’m used to Edgar and Isabella Linton.\n",
      "Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She had some reason to put the question, for shame and pride threw\n",
      "double gloom over his countenance, and kept him immovable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shake hands, Heathcliff,” said Mr. Earnshaw, condescendingly; “once in\n",
      "a way, that is permitted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall not,” replied the boy, finding his tongue at last; “I shall\n",
      "not stand to be laughed at. I shall not bear it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And he would have broken from the circle, but Miss Cathy seized him\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I did not mean to laugh at you,” she said; “I could not hinder myself:\n",
      "Heathcliff, shake hands at least! What are you sulky for? It was only\n",
      "that you looked odd. If you wash your face and brush your hair, it will\n",
      "be all right: but you are so dirty!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own, and\n",
      "also at her dress; which she feared had gained no embellishment from\n",
      "its contact with his.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You needn’t have touched me!” he answered, following her eye and\n",
      "snatching away his hand. “I shall be as dirty as I please: and I like\n",
      "to be dirty, and I will be dirty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that he dashed headforemost out of the room, amid the merriment of\n",
      "the master and mistress, and to the serious disturbance of Catherine;\n",
      "who could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an\n",
      "exhibition of bad temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "After playing lady’s-maid to the new-comer, and putting my cakes in the\n",
      "oven, and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires,\n",
      "befitting Christmas-eve, I prepared to sit down and amuse myself by\n",
      "singing carols, all alone; regardless of Joseph’s affirmations that he\n",
      "considered the merry tunes I chose as next door to songs. He had\n",
      "retired to private prayer in his chamber, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw\n",
      "were engaging Missy’s attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to\n",
      "present to the little Lintons, as an acknowledgment of their kindness.\n",
      "They had invited them to spend the morrow at Wuthering Heights, and the\n",
      "invitation had been accepted, on one condition: Mrs. Linton begged that\n",
      "her darlings might be kept carefully apart from that “naughty swearing\n",
      "boy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Under these circumstances I remained solitary. I smelt the rich scent\n",
      "of the heating spices; and admired the shining kitchen utensils, the\n",
      "polished clock, decked in holly, the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready\n",
      "to be filled with mulled ale for supper; and above all, the speckless\n",
      "purity of my particular care—the scoured and well-swept floor. I gave\n",
      "due inward applause to every object, and then I remembered how old\n",
      "Earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied, and call me a cant lass,\n",
      "and slip a shilling into my hand as a Christmas-box; and from that I\n",
      "went on to think of his fondness for Heathcliff, and his dread lest he\n",
      "should suffer neglect after death had removed him: and that naturally\n",
      "led me to consider the poor lad’s situation now, and from singing I\n",
      "changed my mind to crying. It struck me soon, however, there would be\n",
      "more sense in endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding\n",
      "tears over them: I got up and walked into the court to seek him. He was\n",
      "not far; I found him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the\n",
      "stable, and feeding the other beasts, according to custom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Make haste, Heathcliff!” I said, “the kitchen is so comfortable; and\n",
      "Joseph is upstairs: make haste, and let me dress you smart before Miss\n",
      "Cathy comes out, and then you can sit together, with the whole hearth\n",
      "to yourselves, and have a long chatter till bedtime.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He proceeded with his task, and never turned his head towards me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come—are you coming?” I continued. “There’s a little cake for each of\n",
      "you, nearly enough; and you’ll need half-an-hour’s donning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I waited five minutes, but getting no answer left him. Catherine supped\n",
      "with her brother and sister-in-law: Joseph and I joined at an\n",
      "unsociable meal, seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on\n",
      "the other. His cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the\n",
      "fairies. He managed to continue work till nine o’clock, and then\n",
      "marched dumb and dour to his chamber. Cathy sat up late, having a world\n",
      "of things to order for the reception of her new friends: she came into\n",
      "the kitchen once to speak to her old one; but he was gone, and she only\n",
      "stayed to ask what was the matter with him, and then went back. In the\n",
      "morning he rose early; and, as it was a holiday, carried his ill-humour\n",
      "on to the moors; not re-appearing till the family were departed for\n",
      "church. Fasting and reflection seemed to have brought him to a better\n",
      "spirit. He hung about me for a while, and having screwed up his\n",
      "courage, exclaimed abruptly—“Nelly, make me decent, I’m going to be\n",
      "good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“High time, Heathcliff,” I said; “you _have_ grieved Catherine: she’s\n",
      "sorry she ever came home, I daresay! It looks as if you envied her,\n",
      "because she is more thought of than you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The notion of _envying_ Catherine was incomprehensible to him, but the\n",
      "notion of grieving her he understood clearly enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did she say she was grieved?” he inquired, looking very serious.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She cried when I told her you were off again this morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, _I_ cried last night,” he returned, “and I had more reason to\n",
      "cry than she.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes: you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an\n",
      "empty stomach,” said I. “Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves.\n",
      "But, if you be ashamed of your touchiness, you must ask pardon, mind,\n",
      "when she comes in. You must go up and offer to kiss her, and say—you\n",
      "know best what to say; only do it heartily, and not as if you thought\n",
      "her converted into a stranger by her grand dress. And now, though I\n",
      "have dinner to get ready, I’ll steal time to arrange you so that Edgar\n",
      "Linton shall look quite a doll beside you: and that he does. You are\n",
      "younger, and yet, I’ll be bound, you are taller and twice as broad\n",
      "across the shoulders; you could knock him down in a twinkling; don’t\n",
      "you feel that you could?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Heathcliff’s face brightened a moment; then it was overcast afresh, and\n",
      "he sighed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Nelly, if I knocked him down twenty times, that wouldn’t make him\n",
      "less handsome or me more so. I wish I had light hair and a fair skin,\n",
      "and was dressed and behaved as well, and had a chance of being as rich\n",
      "as he will be!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And cried for mamma at every turn,” I added, “and trembled if a\n",
      "country lad heaved his fist against you, and sat at home all day for a\n",
      "shower of rain. Oh, Heathcliff, you are showing a poor spirit! Come to\n",
      "the glass, and I’ll let you see what you should wish. Do you mark those\n",
      "two lines between your eyes; and those thick brows, that, instead of\n",
      "rising arched, sink in the middle; and that couple of black fiends, so\n",
      "deeply buried, who never open their windows boldly, but lurk glinting\n",
      "under them, like devil’s spies? Wish and learn to smooth away the surly\n",
      "wrinkles, to raise your lids frankly, and change the fiends to\n",
      "confident, innocent angels, suspecting and doubting nothing, and always\n",
      "seeing friends where they are not sure of foes. Don’t get the\n",
      "expression of a vicious cur that appears to know the kicks it gets are\n",
      "its desert, and yet hates all the world, as well as the kicker, for\n",
      "what it suffers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton’s great blue eyes and\n",
      "even forehead,” he replied. “I do—and that won’t help me to them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad,” I continued, “if\n",
      "you were a regular black; and a bad one will turn the bonniest into\n",
      "something worse than ugly. And now that we’ve done washing, and\n",
      "combing, and sulking—tell me whether you don’t think yourself rather\n",
      "handsome? I’ll tell you, I do. You’re fit for a prince in disguise. Who\n",
      "knows but your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian\n",
      "queen, each of them able to buy up, with one week’s income, Wuthering\n",
      "Heights and Thrushcross Grange together? And you were kidnapped by\n",
      "wicked sailors and brought to England. Were I in your place, I would\n",
      "frame high notions of my birth; and the thoughts of what I was should\n",
      "give me courage and dignity to support the oppressions of a little\n",
      "farmer!”\n",
      "\n",
      "So I chattered on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to\n",
      "look quite pleasant, when all at once our conversation was interrupted\n",
      "by a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court. He ran\n",
      "to the window and I to the door, just in time to behold the two Lintons\n",
      "descend from the family carriage, smothered in cloaks and furs, and the\n",
      "Earnshaws dismount from their horses: they often rode to church in\n",
      "winter. Catherine took a hand of each of the children, and brought them\n",
      "into the house and set them before the fire, which quickly put colour\n",
      "into their white faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "I urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour, and he\n",
      "willingly obeyed; but ill luck would have it that, as he opened the\n",
      "door leading from the kitchen on one side, Hindley opened it on the\n",
      "other. They met, and the master, irritated at seeing him clean and\n",
      "cheerful, or, perhaps, eager to keep his promise to Mrs. Linton, shoved\n",
      "him back with a sudden thrust, and angrily bade Joseph “keep the fellow\n",
      "out of the room—send him into the garret till dinner is over. He’ll be\n",
      "cramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit, if left alone\n",
      "with them a minute.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay, sir,” I could not avoid answering, “he’ll touch nothing, not he:\n",
      "and I suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He shall have his share of my hand, if I catch him downstairs till\n",
      "dark,” cried Hindley. “Begone, you vagabond! What! you are attempting\n",
      "the coxcomb, are you? Wait till I get hold of those elegant locks—see\n",
      "if I won’t pull them a bit longer!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are long enough already,” observed Master Linton, peeping from\n",
      "the doorway; “I wonder they don’t make his head ache. It’s like a\n",
      "colt’s mane over his eyes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He ventured this remark without any intention to insult; but\n",
      "Heathcliff’s violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance\n",
      "of impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate, even then, as a rival.\n",
      "He seized a tureen of hot apple sauce, the first thing that came under\n",
      "his gripe, and dashed it full against the speaker’s face and neck; who\n",
      "instantly commenced a lament that brought Isabella and Catherine\n",
      "hurrying to the place. Mr. Earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly\n",
      "and conveyed him to his chamber; where, doubtless, he administered a\n",
      "rough remedy to cool the fit of passion, for he appeared red and\n",
      "breathless. I got the dish-cloth, and rather spitefully scrubbed\n",
      "Edgar’s nose and mouth, affirming it served him right for meddling. His\n",
      "sister began weeping to go home, and Cathy stood by confounded,\n",
      "blushing for all.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You should not have spoken to him!” she expostulated with Master\n",
      "Linton. “He was in a bad temper, and now you’ve spoilt your visit; and\n",
      "he’ll be flogged: I hate him to be flogged! I can’t eat my dinner. Why\n",
      "did you speak to him, Edgar?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t,” sobbed the youth, escaping from my hands, and finishing the\n",
      "remainder of the purification with his cambric pocket-handkerchief. “I\n",
      "promised mamma that I wouldn’t say one word to him, and I didn’t.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, don’t cry,” replied Catherine, contemptuously; “you’re not\n",
      "killed. Don’t make more mischief; my brother is coming: be quiet! Hush,\n",
      "Isabella! Has anybody hurt _you?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There, there, children—to your seats!” cried Hindley, bustling in.\n",
      "“That brute of a lad has warmed me nicely. Next time, Master Edgar,\n",
      "take the law into your own fists—it will give you an appetite!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant\n",
      "feast. They were hungry after their ride, and easily consoled, since no\n",
      "real harm had befallen them. Mr. Earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls,\n",
      "and the mistress made them merry with lively talk. I waited behind her\n",
      "chair, and was pained to behold Catherine, with dry eyes and an\n",
      "indifferent air, commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her.\n",
      "“An unfeeling child,” I thought to myself; “how lightly she dismisses\n",
      "her old playmate’s troubles. I could not have imagined her to be so\n",
      "selfish.” She lifted a mouthful to her lips: then she set it down\n",
      "again: her cheeks flushed, and the tears gushed over them. She slipped\n",
      "her fork to the floor, and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her\n",
      "emotion. I did not call her unfeeling long; for I perceived she was in\n",
      "purgatory throughout the day, and wearying to find an opportunity of\n",
      "getting by herself, or paying a visit to Heathcliff, who had been\n",
      "locked up by the master: as I discovered, on endeavouring to introduce\n",
      "to him a private mess of victuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the evening we had a dance. Cathy begged that he might be liberated\n",
      "then, as Isabella Linton had no partner: her entreaties were vain, and\n",
      "I was appointed to supply the deficiency. We got rid of all gloom in\n",
      "the excitement of the exercise, and our pleasure was increased by the\n",
      "arrival of the Gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong: a trumpet, a\n",
      "trombone, clarionets, bassoons, French horns, and a bass viol, besides\n",
      "singers. They go the rounds of all the respectable houses, and receive\n",
      "contributions every Christmas, and we esteemed it a first-rate treat to\n",
      "hear them. After the usual carols had been sung, we set them to songs\n",
      "and glees. Mrs. Earnshaw loved the music, and so they gave us plenty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Catherine loved it too: but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of\n",
      "the steps, and she went up in the dark: I followed. They shut the house\n",
      "door below, never noting our absence, it was so full of people. She\n",
      "made no stay at the stairs’-head, but mounted farther, to the garret\n",
      "where Heathcliff was confined, and called him. He stubbornly declined\n",
      "answering for a while: she persevered, and finally persuaded him to\n",
      "hold communion with her through the boards. I let the poor things\n",
      "converse unmolested, till I supposed the songs were going to cease, and\n",
      "the singers to get some refreshment: then I clambered up the ladder to\n",
      "warn her. Instead of finding her outside, I heard her voice within. The\n",
      "little monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret, along the roof,\n",
      "into the skylight of the other, and it was with the utmost difficulty I\n",
      "could coax her out again. When she did come, Heathcliff came with her,\n",
      "and she insisted that I should take him into the kitchen, as my\n",
      "fellow-servant had gone to a neighbour’s, to be removed from the sound\n",
      "of our “devil’s psalmody,” as it pleased him to call it. I told them I\n",
      "intended by no means to encourage their tricks: but as the prisoner had\n",
      "never broken his fast since yesterday’s dinner, I would wink at his\n",
      "cheating Mr. Hindley that once. He went down: I set him a stool by the\n",
      "fire, and offered him a quantity of good things: but he was sick and\n",
      "could eat little, and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away. He\n",
      "leant his two elbows on his knees, and his chin on his hands, and\n",
      "remained rapt in dumb meditation. On my inquiring the subject of his\n",
      "thoughts, he answered gravely—“I’m trying to settle how I shall pay\n",
      "Hindley back. I don’t care how long I wait, if I can only do it at\n",
      "last. I hope he will not die before I do!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For shame, Heathcliff!” said I. “It is for God to punish wicked\n",
      "people; we should learn to forgive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, God won’t have the satisfaction that I shall,” he returned. “I\n",
      "only wish I knew the best way! Let me alone, and I’ll plan it out:\n",
      "while I’m thinking of that I don’t feel pain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, Mr. Lockwood, I forget these tales cannot divert you. I’m annoyed\n",
      "how I should dream of chattering on at such a rate; and your gruel\n",
      "cold, and you nodding for bed! I could have told Heathcliff’s history,\n",
      "all that you need hear, in half a dozen words.\n",

      "Thus interrupting herself, the housekeeper rose, and proceeded to lay\n",
      "aside her sewing; but I felt incapable of moving from the hearth, and I\n",
      "was very far from nodding. “Sit still, Mrs. Dean,” I cried; “do sit\n",
      "still another half-hour. You’ve done just right to tell the story\n",
      "leisurely. That is the method I like; and you must finish it in the\n",
      "same style. I am interested in every character you have mentioned, more\n",
      "or less.”\n",

      "“The clock is on the stroke of eleven, sir.”\n",
      "\n",

      "two is early enough for a person who lies till ten.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shouldn’t lie till ten. There’s the very prime of the morning gone\n",
      "long before that time. A person who has not done one-half his day’s\n",

      "years; during that space Mrs. Earnshaw—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no, I’ll allow nothing of the sort! Are you acquainted with the\n",
      "mood of mind in which, if you were seated alone, and the cat licking\n",
      "its kitten on the rug before you, you would watch the operation so\n",
      "intently that puss’s neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of\n",

      "acquire over people in towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does\n",
      "over a spider in a cottage, to their various occupants; and yet the\n",
      "deepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the\n",
      "looker-on. They _do_ live more in earnest, more in themselves, and less\n",
      "in surface, change, and frivolous external things. I could fancy a love\n",
      "for life here almost possible; and I was a fixed unbeliever in any love\n",
      "of a year’s standing. One state resembles setting a hungry man down to\n",
      "a single dish, on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do\n",
      "it justice; the other, introducing him to a table laid out by French\n",

      "I have read more than you would fancy, Mr. Lockwood. You could not open\n",
      "a book in this library that I have not looked into, and got something\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the morning of a fine June day my first bonny little nursling, and\n",
      "the last of the ancient Earnshaw stock, was born. We were busy with the\n",
      "hay in a far-away field, when the girl that usually brought our\n",
      "breakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the\n",
      "lane, calling me as she ran.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, such a grand bairn!” she panted out. “The finest lad that ever\n",
      "breathed! But the doctor says missis must go: he says she’s been in a\n",
      "consumption these many months. I heard him tell Mr. Hindley: and now\n",
      "she has nothing to keep her, and she’ll be dead before winter. You must\n",
      "come home directly. You’re to nurse it, Nelly: to feed it with sugar\n",
      "and milk, and take care of it day and night. I wish I were you, because\n",
      "it will be all yours when there is no missis!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But is she very ill?” I asked, flinging down my rake and tying my\n",
      "bonnet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I guess she is; yet she looks bravely,” replied the girl, “and she\n",
      "talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man. She’s out of\n",
      "her head for joy, it’s such a beauty! If I were her I’m certain I\n",
      "should not die: I should get better at the bare sight of it, in spite\n",
      "of Kenneth. I was fairly mad at him. Dame Archer brought the cherub\n",
      "down to master, in the house, and his face just began to light up, when\n",
      "the old croaker steps forward, and says he—‘Earnshaw, it’s a blessing\n",
      "your wife has been spared to leave you this son. When she came, I felt\n",
      "convinced we shouldn’t keep her long; and now, I must tell you, the\n",
      "winter will probably finish her. Don’t take on, and fret about it too\n",
      "much: it can’t be helped. And besides, you should have known better\n",
      "than to choose such a rush of a lass!’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what did the master answer?” I inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think he swore: but I didn’t mind him, I was straining to see the\n",
      "bairn,” and she began again to describe it rapturously. I, as zealous\n",
      "as herself, hurried eagerly home to admire, on my part; though I was\n",
      "very sad for Hindley’s sake. He had room in his heart only for two\n",
      "idols—his wife and himself: he doted on both, and adored one, and I\n",
      "couldn’t conceive how he would bear the loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got to Wuthering Heights, there he stood at the front door;\n",
      "and, as I passed in, I asked, “how was the baby?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nearly ready to run about, Nell!” he replied, putting on a cheerful\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And the mistress?” I ventured to inquire; “the doctor says she’s—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Damn the doctor!” he interrupted, reddening. “Frances is quite right:\n",
      "she’ll be perfectly well by this time next week. Are you going\n",
      "upstairs? will you tell her that I’ll come, if she’ll promise not to\n",
      "talk. I left her because she would not hold her tongue; and she\n",
      "must—tell her Mr. Kenneth says she must be quiet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I delivered this message to Mrs. Earnshaw; she seemed in flighty\n",
      "spirits, and replied merrily, “I hardly spoke a word, Ellen, and there\n",
      "he has gone out twice, crying. Well, say I promise I won’t speak: but\n",
      "that does not bind me not to laugh at him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor soul! Till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed\n",
      "her; and her husband persisted doggedly, nay, furiously, in affirming\n",
      "her health improved every day. When Kenneth warned him that his\n",
      "medicines were useless at that stage of the malady, and he needn’t put\n",
      "him to further expense by attending her, he retorted, “I know you need\n",
      "not—she’s well—she does not want any more attendance from you! She\n",
      "never was in a consumption. It was a fever; and it is gone: her pulse\n",
      "is as slow as mine now, and her cheek as cool.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He told his wife the same story, and she seemed to believe him; but one\n",
      "night, while leaning on his shoulder, in the act of saying she thought\n",
      "she should be able to get up to-morrow, a fit of coughing took her—a\n",
      "very slight one—he raised her in his arms; she put her two hands about\n",
      "his neck, her face changed, and she was dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the girl had anticipated, the child Hareton fell wholly into my\n",
      "hands. Mr. Earnshaw, provided he saw him healthy and never heard him\n",
      "cry, was contented, as far as regarded him. For himself, he grew\n",
      "desperate: his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament. He neither\n",
      "wept nor prayed; he cursed and defied: execrated God and man, and gave\n",
      "himself up to reckless dissipation. The servants could not bear his\n",
      "tyrannical and evil conduct long: Joseph and I were the only two that\n",
      "would stay. I had not the heart to leave my charge; and besides, you\n",
      "know, I had been his foster-sister, and excused his behaviour more\n",
      "readily than a stranger would. Joseph remained to hector over tenants\n",
      "and labourers; and because it was his vocation to be where he had\n",
      "plenty of wickedness to reprove.\n",
      "\n",
      "The master’s bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for\n",
      "Catherine and Heathcliff. His treatment of the latter was enough to\n",
      "make a fiend of a saint. And, truly, it appeared as if the lad _were_\n",
      "possessed of something diabolical at that period. He delighted to\n",
      "witness Hindley degrading himself past redemption; and became daily\n",
      "more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity. I could not half tell\n",
      "what an infernal house we had. The curate dropped calling, and nobody\n",
      "decent came near us, at last; unless Edgar Linton’s visits to Miss\n",
      "Cathy might be an exception. At fifteen she was the queen of the\n",
      "country-side; she had no peer; and she did turn out a haughty,\n",
      "headstrong creature! I own I did not like her, after infancy was past;\n",
      "and I vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance: she\n",
      "never took an aversion to me, though. She had a wondrous constancy to\n",
      "old attachments: even Heathcliff kept his hold on her affections\n",
      "unalterably; and young Linton, with all his superiority, found it\n",
      "difficult to make an equally deep impression. He was my late master:\n",
      "that is his portrait over the fireplace. It used to hang on one side,\n",
      "and his wife’s on the other; but hers has been removed, or else you\n",
      "might see something of what she was. Can you make that out?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dean raised the candle, and I discerned a soft-featured face,\n",
      "exceedingly resembling the young lady at the Heights, but more pensive\n",
      "and amiable in expression. It formed a sweet picture. The long light\n",
      "hair curled slightly on the temples; the eyes were large and serious;\n",
      "the figure almost too graceful. I did not marvel how Catherine Earnshaw\n",
      "could forget her first friend for such an individual. I marvelled much\n",
      "how he, with a mind to correspond with his person, could fancy my idea\n",
      "of Catherine Earnshaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A very agreeable portrait,” I observed to the house-keeper. “Is it\n",
      "like?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” she answered; “but he looked better when he was animated; that\n",
      "is his everyday countenance: he wanted spirit in general.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the Lintons since her\n",
      "five-weeks’ residence among them; and as she had no temptation to show\n",
      "her rough side in their company, and had the sense to be ashamed of\n",
      "being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy, she imposed\n",
      "unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality;\n",
      "gained the admiration of Isabella, and the heart and soul of her\n",
      "brother: acquisitions that flattered her from the first—for she was\n",
      "full of ambition—and led her to adopt a double character without\n",
      "exactly intending to deceive any one. In the place where she heard\n",
      "Heathcliff termed a “vulgar young ruffian,” and “worse than a brute,”\n",
      "she took care not to act like him; but at home she had small\n",
      "inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at, and\n",
      "restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor\n",
      "praise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Edgar seldom mustered courage to visit Wuthering Heights openly. He\n",
      "had a terror of Earnshaw’s reputation, and shrunk from encountering\n",
      "him; and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility:\n",
      "the master himself avoided offending him, knowing why he came; and if\n",
      "he could not be gracious, kept out of the way. I rather think his\n",
      "appearance there was distasteful to Catherine; she was not artful,\n",
      "never played the coquette, and had evidently an objection to her two\n",
      "friends meeting at all; for when Heathcliff expressed contempt of\n",
      "Linton in his presence, she could not half coincide, as she did in his\n",
      "absence; and when Linton evinced disgust and antipathy to Heathcliff,\n",
      "she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference, as if\n",
      "depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her.\n",
      "I’ve had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles, which\n",
      "she vainly strove to hide from my mockery. That sounds ill-natured: but\n",
      "she was so proud, it became really impossible to pity her distresses,\n",
      "till she should be chastened into more humility. She did bring herself,\n",
      "finally, to confess, and to confide in me: there was not a soul else\n",
      "that she might fashion into an adviser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Hindley had gone from home one afternoon, and Heathcliff presumed\n",
      "to give himself a holiday on the strength of it. He had reached the age\n",
      "of sixteen then, I think, and without having bad features, or being\n",
      "deficient in intellect, he contrived to convey an impression of inward\n",
      "and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of.\n",
      "In the first place, he had by that time lost the benefit of his early\n",
      "education: continual hard work, begun soon and concluded late, had\n",
      "extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge,\n",
      "and any love for books or learning. His childhood’s sense of\n",
      "superiority, instilled into him by the favours of old Mr. Earnshaw, was\n",
      "faded away. He struggled long to keep up an equality with Catherine in\n",
      "her studies, and yielded with poignant though silent regret: but he\n",
      "yielded completely; and there was no prevailing on him to take a step\n",
      "in the way of moving upward, when he found he must, necessarily, sink\n",
      "beneath his former level. Then personal appearance sympathised with\n",
      "mental deterioration: he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look;\n",
      "his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost\n",
      "idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness; and he took a grim pleasure,\n",
      "apparently, in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few\n",
      "acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of\n",
      "respite from labour; but he had ceased to express his fondness for her\n",
      "in words, and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses,\n",
      "as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks\n",
      "of affection on him. On the before-named occasion he came into the\n",
      "house to announce his intention of doing nothing, while I was assisting\n",
      "Miss Cathy to arrange her dress: she had not reckoned on his taking it\n",
      "into his head to be idle; and imagining she would have the whole place\n",
      "to herself, she managed, by some means, to inform Mr. Edgar of her\n",
      "brother’s absence, and was then preparing to receive him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?” asked Heathcliff. “Are you going\n",
      "anywhere?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, it is raining,” she answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why have you that silk frock on, then?” he said. “Nobody coming here,\n",
      "I hope?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not that I know of,” stammered Miss: “but you should be in the field\n",
      "now, Heathcliff. It is an hour past dinner time; I thought you were\n",
      "gone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence,” observed\n",
      "the boy. “I’ll not work any more to-day: I’ll stay with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, but Joseph will tell,” she suggested; “you’d better go!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Joseph is loading lime on the further side of Penistone Crags; it will\n",
      "take him till dark, and he’ll never know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, he lounged to the fire, and sat down. Catherine reflected\n",
      "an instant, with knitted brows—she found it needful to smooth the way\n",
      "for an intrusion. “Isabella and Edgar Linton talked of calling this\n",
      "afternoon,” she said, at the conclusion of a minute’s silence. “As it\n",
      "rains, I hardly expect them; but they may come, and if they do, you run\n",
      "the risk of being scolded for no good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Order Ellen to say you are engaged, Cathy,” he persisted; “don’t turn\n",
      "me out for those pitiful, silly friends of yours! I’m on the point,\n",
      "sometimes, of complaining that they—but I’ll not—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That they what?” cried Catherine, gazing at him with a troubled\n",
      "countenance. “Oh, Nelly!” she added petulantly, jerking her head away\n",
      "from my hands, “you’ve combed my hair quite out of curl! That’s enough;\n",
      "let me alone. What are you on the point of complaining about,\n",
      "Heathcliff?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing—only look at the almanack on that wall;” he pointed to a\n",
      "framed sheet hanging near the window, and continued, “The crosses are\n",
      "for the evenings you have spent with the Lintons, the dots for those\n",
      "spent with me. Do you see? I’ve marked every day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes—very foolish: as if I took notice!” replied Catherine, in a\n",
      "peevish tone. “And where is the sense of that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To show that I _do_ take notice,” said Heathcliff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And should I always be sitting with you?” she demanded, growing more\n",
      "irritated. “What good do I get? What do you talk about? You might be\n",
      "dumb, or a baby, for anything you say to amuse me, or for anything you\n",
      "do, either!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You never told me before that I talked too little, or that you\n",
      "disliked my company, Cathy!” exclaimed Heathcliff, in much agitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s no company at all, when people know nothing and say nothing,” she\n",
      "muttered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her companion rose up, but he hadn’t time to express his feelings\n",
      "further, for a horse’s feet were heard on the flags, and having knocked\n",
      "gently, young Linton entered, his face brilliant with delight at the\n",
      "unexpected summons he had received. Doubtless Catherine marked the\n",
      "difference between her friends, as one came in and the other went out.\n",
      "The contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, coal\n",
      "country for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and greeting were\n",
      "as opposite as his aspect. He had a sweet, low manner of speaking, and\n",
      "pronounced his words as you do: that’s less gruff than we talk here,\n",

      "\n",
      "“No,” answered Catherine. “What are you doing there, Nelly?”\n",
      "\n",

      "She stepped behind me and whispered crossly, “Take yourself and your\n",

      "She, supposing Edgar could not see her, snatched the cloth from my\n",
      "hand, and pinched me, with a prolonged wrench, very spitefully on the\n",
      "arm. I’ve said I did not love her, and rather relished mortifying her\n",
      "vanity now and then: besides, she hurt me extremely; so I started up\n",
      "from my knees, and screamed out, “Oh, Miss, that’s a nasty trick! You\n",
      "have no right to nip me, and I’m not going to bear it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t touch you, you lying creature!” cried she, her fingers\n",
      "tingling to repeat the act, and her ears red with rage. She never had\n",
      "power to conceal her passion, it always set her whole complexion in a\n",
      "blaze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s that, then?” I retorted, showing a decided purple witness to\n",
      "refute her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stamped her foot, wavered a moment, and then, irresistibly impelled\n",
      "by the naughty spirit within her, slapped me on the cheek: a stinging\n",
      "blow that filled both eyes with water.\n",
      "\n",

      "Little Hareton, who followed me everywhere, and was sitting near me on\n",
      "the floor, at seeing my tears commenced crying himself, and sobbed out\n",
      "complaints against “wicked aunt Cathy,” which drew her fury on to his\n",
      "unlucky head: she seized his shoulders, and shook him till the poor\n",
      "child waxed livid, and Edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to\n",
      "deliver him. In an instant one was wrung free, and the astonished young\n",
      "man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be\n",
      "mistaken for jest. He drew back in consternation. I lifted Hareton in\n",
      "my arms, and walked off to the kitchen with him, leaving the door of\n",
      "communication open, for I was curious to watch how they would settle\n",
      "their disagreement. The insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had\n",
      "laid his hat, pale and with a quivering lip.\n",
      "\n",

      "“Where are you going?” demanded Catherine, advancing to the door.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“No,” she persisted, grasping the handle; “not yet, Edgar Linton: sit\n",
      "down; you shall not leave me in that temper. I should be miserable all\n",
      "night, and I won’t be miserable for you!”\n",
      "\n",

      "cry myself sick!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She dropped down on her knees by a chair, and set to weeping in serious\n",
      "earnest. Edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court; there\n",
      "he lingered. I resolved to encourage him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss is dreadfully wayward, sir,” I called out. “As bad as any marred\n",

      "grieve us.”\n",
      "\n",

      "half killed, or a bird half eaten. Ah, I thought, there will be no\n",
      "saving him: he’s doomed, and flies to his fate! And so it was: he\n",
      "turned abruptly, hastened into the house again, shut the door behind\n",
      "him; and when I went in a while after to inform them that Earnshaw had\n",
      "come home rabid drunk, ready to pull the whole place about our ears\n",

      "confess themselves lovers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intelligence of Mr. Hindley’s arrival drove Linton speedily to his\n",

      "to take the shot out of the master’s fowling-piece, which he was fond\n",
      "of playing with in his insane excitement, to the hazard of the lives of\n",
      "any who provoked, or even attracted his notice too much; and I had hit\n",

      "He entered, vociferating oaths dreadful to hear; and caught me in the\n",
      "act of stowing his son away in the kitchen cupboard. Hareton was\n",
      "impressed with a wholesome terror of encountering either his wild\n",
      "beast’s fondness or his madman’s rage; for in one he ran a chance of\n",
      "being squeezed and kissed to death, and in the other of being flung\n",
      "into the fire, or dashed against the wall; and the poor thing remained\n",
      "perfectly quiet wherever I chose to put him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There, I’ve found it out at last!” cried Hindley, pulling me back by\n",
      "the skin of my neck, like a dog. “By heaven and hell, you’ve sworn\n",
      "between you to murder that child! I know how it is, now, that he is\n",
      "always out of my way. But, with the help of Satan, I shall make you\n",
      "swallow the carving-knife, Nelly! You needn’t laugh; for I’ve just\n",

      "“But I don’t like the carving-knife, Mr. Hindley,” I answered; “it has\n",
      "been cutting red herrings. I’d rather be shot, if you please.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’d rather be damned!” he said; “and so you shall. No law in England\n",
      "can hinder a man from keeping his house decent, and mine’s abominable!\n",
      "Open your mouth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He held the knife in his hand, and pushed its point between my teeth:\n",
      "but, for my part, I was never much afraid of his vagaries. I spat out,\n",
      "and affirmed it tasted detestably—I would not take it on any account.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” said he, releasing me, “I see that hideous little villain is not\n",
      "Hareton: I beg your pardon, Nell. If it be, he deserves flaying alive\n",
      "for not running to welcome me, and for screaming as if I were a goblin.\n",
      "Unnatural cub, come hither! I’ll teach thee to impose on a\n",
      "good-hearted, deluded father. Now, don’t you think the lad would be\n",
      "handsomer cropped? It makes a dog fiercer, and I love something\n",
      "fierce—get me a scissors—something fierce and trim! Besides, it’s\n",
      "infernal affectation—devilish conceit it is, to cherish our ears—we’re\n",
      "asses enough without them. Hush, child, hush! Well then, it is my\n",
      "darling! wisht, dry thy eyes—there’s a joy; kiss me. What! it won’t?\n",
      "Kiss me, Hareton! Damn thee, kiss me! By God, as if I would rear such a\n",
      "monster! As sure as I’m living, I’ll break the brat’s neck.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Hareton was squalling and kicking in his father’s arms with all\n",
      "his might, and redoubled his yells when he carried him upstairs and\n",
      "lifted him over the banister. I cried out that he would frighten the\n",
      "child into fits, and ran to rescue him. As I reached them, Hindley\n",
      "leant forward on the rails to listen to a noise below; almost\n",
      "forgetting what he had in his hands. “Who is that?” he asked, hearing\n",
      "some one approaching the stairs’-foot. I leant forward also, for the\n",
      "purpose of signing to Heathcliff, whose step I recognised, not to come\n",
      "further; and, at the instant when my eye quitted Hareton, he gave a\n",
      "sudden spring, delivered himself from the careless grasp that held him,\n",
      "and fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror before we saw\n",
      "that the little wretch was safe. Heathcliff arrived underneath just at\n",
      "the critical moment; by a natural impulse he arrested his descent, and\n",
      "setting him on his feet, looked up to discover the author of the\n",
      "accident. A miser who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five\n",
      "shillings, and finds next day he has lost in the bargain five thousand\n",
      "pounds, could not show a blanker countenance than he did on beholding\n",
      "the figure of Mr. Earnshaw above. It expressed, plainer than words\n",
      "could do, the intensest anguish at having made himself the instrument\n",
      "of thwarting his own revenge. Had it been dark, I daresay he would have\n",
      "tried to remedy the mistake by smashing Hareton’s skull on the steps;\n",
      "but, we witnessed his salvation; and I was presently below with my\n",
      "precious charge pressed to my heart. Hindley descended more leisurely,\n",
      "sobered and abashed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is your fault, Ellen,” he said; “you should have kept him out of\n",

      "\n",
      "“Injured!” I cried angrily; “if he is not killed, he’ll be an idiot!\n",
      "Oh! I wonder his mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use\n",
      "him. You’re worse than a heathen—treating your own flesh and blood in\n",
      "that manner!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He attempted to touch the child, who, on finding himself with me,\n",
      "sobbed off his terror directly. At the first finger his father laid on\n",
      "him, however, he shrieked again louder than before, and struggled as if\n",
      "he would go into convulsions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shall not meddle with him!” I continued. “He hates you—they all\n",
      "hate you—that’s the truth! A happy family you have; and a pretty state\n",
      "you’re come to!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall come to a prettier, yet, Nelly,” laughed the misguided man,\n",
      "recovering his hardness. “At present, convey yourself and him away. And\n",
      "hark you, Heathcliff! clear you too quite from my reach and hearing. I\n",
      "wouldn’t murder you to-night; unless, perhaps, I set the house on fire:\n",
      "but that’s as my fancy goes.”\n",

      "from his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not I! On the contrary, I shall have great pleasure in sending it to\n",
      "perdition to punish its Maker,” exclaimed the blasphemer. “Here’s to\n",
      "its hearty damnation!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go; terminating his\n",
      "command with a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to repeat or\n",
      "remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a pity he cannot kill himself with drink,” observed Heathcliff,\n",
      "muttering an echo of curses back when the door was shut. “He’s doing\n",
      "his very utmost; but his constitution defies him. Mr. Kenneth says he\n",
      "would wager his mare that he’ll outlive any man on this side Gimmerton,\n",

      "common course befall him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I went into the kitchen, and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep.\n",
      "Heathcliff, as I thought, walked through to the barn. It turned out\n",
      "afterwards that he only got as far as the other side the settle, when\n",
      "he flung himself on a bench by the wall, removed from the fire, and\n",
      "remained silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was rocking Hareton on my knee, and humming a song that began,—\n",
      "\n",
      "It was far in the night, and the bairnies grat,\n",
      "The mither beneath the mools heard that,\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "when Miss Cathy, who had listened to the hubbub from her room, put her\n",
      "head in, and whispered,—“Are you alone, Nelly?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Miss,” I replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "She entered and approached the hearth. I, supposing she was going to\n",
      "say something, looked up. The expression of her face seemed disturbed\n",
      "and anxious. Her lips were half asunder, as if she meant to speak, and\n",
      "she drew a breath; but it escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence. I\n",
      "resumed my song; not having forgotten her recent behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where’s Heathcliff?” she said, interrupting me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“About his work in the stable,” was my answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not contradict me; perhaps he had fallen into a doze. There\n",
      "followed another long pause, during which I perceived a drop or two\n",
      "trickle from Catherine’s cheek to the flags. Is she sorry for her\n",
      "shameful conduct?—I asked myself. That will be a novelty: but she may\n",
      "come to the point as she will—I sha’n’t help her! No, she felt small\n",
      "trouble regarding any subject, save her own concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, dear!” she cried at last. “I’m very unhappy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A pity,” observed I. “You’re hard to please; so many friends and so\n",
      "few cares, and can’t make yourself content!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nelly, will you keep a secret for me?” she pursued, kneeling down by\n",
      "me, and lifting her winsome eyes to my face with that sort of look\n",
      "which turns off bad temper, even when one has all the right in the\n",
      "world to indulge it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it worth keeping?” I inquired, less sulkily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, and it worries me, and I must let it out! I want to know what I\n",
      "should do. To-day, Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him, and I’ve\n",
      "given him an answer. Now, before I tell you whether it was a consent or\n",
      "denial, you tell me which it ought to have been.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really, Miss Catherine, how can I know?” I replied. “To be sure,\n",
      "considering the exhibition you performed in his presence this\n",
      "afternoon, I might say it would be wise to refuse him: since he asked\n",
      "you after that, he must either be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome\n",
      "fool.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you talk so, I won’t tell you any more,” she returned, peevishly\n",
      "rising to her feet. “I accepted him, Nelly. Be quick, and say whether I\n",
      "was wrong!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You accepted him! Then what good is it discussing the matter? You have\n",
      "pledged your word, and cannot retract.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But say whether I should have done so—do!” she exclaimed in an\n",
      "irritated tone; chafing her hands together, and frowning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are many things to be considered before that question can be\n",
      "answered properly,” I said, sententiously. “First and foremost, do you\n",
      "love Mr. Edgar?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who can help it? Of course I do,” she answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I put her through the following catechism: for a girl of\n",
      "twenty-two it was not injudicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why do you love him, Miss Cathy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nonsense, I do—that’s sufficient.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By no means; you must say why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, because he is handsome, and pleasant to be with.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bad!” was my commentary.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And because he is young and cheerful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bad, still.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Indifferent, coming there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And he will be rich, and I shall like to be the greatest woman of the\n",
      "neighbourhood, and I shall be proud of having such a husband.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Worst of all. And now, say how you love him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As everybody loves—You’re silly, Nelly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all—Answer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I love the ground under his feet, and the air over his head, and\n",

      "\n",
      "“And why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay; you are making a jest of it: it is exceedingly ill-natured! It’s\n",
      "no jest to me!” said the young lady, scowling, and turning her face to\n",
      "the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m very far from jesting, Miss Catherine,” I replied. “You love Mr.\n",
      "Edgar because he is handsome, and young, and cheerful, and rich, and\n",
      "loves you. The last, however, goes for nothing: you would love him\n",
      "without that, probably; and with it you wouldn’t, unless he possessed\n",
      "the four former attractions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, to be sure not: I should only pity him—hate him, perhaps, if he\n",
      "were ugly, and a clown.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But there are several other handsome, rich young men in the world:\n",
      "handsomer, possibly, and richer than he is. What should hinder you from\n",

      "“If there be any, they are out of my way: I’ve seen none like Edgar.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may see some; and he won’t always be handsome, and young, and may\n",
      "not always be rich.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is now; and I have only to do with the present. I wish you would\n",
      "speak rationally.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, that settles it: if you have only to do with the present, marry\n",

      "\n",
      "“I don’t want your permission for that—I _shall_ marry him: and yet you\n",
      "have not told me whether I’m right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perfectly right; if people be right to marry only for the present. And\n",
      "now, let us hear what you are unhappy about. Your brother will be\n",
      "pleased; the old lady and gentleman will not object, I think; you will\n",
      "escape from a disorderly, comfortless home into a wealthy, respectable\n",
      "one; and you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you. All seems smooth and\n",
      "easy: where is the obstacle?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Here_! and _here_!” replied Catherine, striking one hand on her\n",
      "forehead, and the other on her breast: “in whichever place the soul\n",
      "lives. In my soul and in my heart, I’m convinced I’m wrong!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s very strange! I cannot make it out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s my secret. But if you will not mock at me, I’ll explain it: I\n",
      "can’t do it distinctly; but I’ll give you a feeling of how I feel.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She seated herself by me again: her countenance grew sadder and graver,\n",
      "and her clasped hands trembled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nelly, do you never dream queer dreams?” she said, suddenly, after\n",
      "some minutes’ reflection.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, now and then,” I answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And so do I. I’ve dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me\n",
      "ever after, and changed my ideas: they’ve gone through and through me,\n",
      "like wine through water, and altered the colour of my mind. And this is\n",
      "one: I’m going to tell it—but take care not to smile at any part of\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! don’t, Miss Catherine!” I cried. “We’re dismal enough without\n",
      "conjuring up ghosts and visions to perplex us. Come, come, be merry and\n",
      "like yourself! Look at little Hareton! _he’s_ dreaming nothing dreary.\n",
      "How sweetly he smiles in his sleep!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; and how sweetly his father curses in his solitude! You remember\n",
      "him, I daresay, when he was just such another as that chubby thing:\n",
      "nearly as young and innocent. However, Nelly, I shall oblige you to\n",
      "listen: it’s not long; and I’ve no power to be merry to-night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won’t hear it, I won’t hear it!” I repeated, hastily.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was superstitious about dreams then, and am still; and Catherine had\n",
      "an unusual gloom in her aspect, that made me dread something from which\n",
      "I might shape a prophecy, and foresee a fearful catastrophe. She was\n",
      "vexed, but she did not proceed. Apparently taking up another subject,\n",
      "she recommenced in a short time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely miserable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because you are not fit to go there,” I answered. “All sinners would\n",
      "be miserable in heaven.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it is not for that. I dreamt once that I was there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I tell you I won’t hearken to your dreams, Miss Catherine! I’ll go to\n",
      "bed,” I interrupted again.\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed, and held me down; for I made a motion to leave my chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is nothing,” cried she: “I was only going to say that heaven did\n",
      "not seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back\n",
      "to earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the\n",
      "middle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke\n",
      "sobbing for joy. That will do to explain my secret, as well as the\n",
      "other. I’ve no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to be in\n",
      "heaven; and if the wicked man in there had not brought Heathcliff so\n",
      "low, I shouldn’t have thought of it. It would degrade me to marry\n",
      "Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not\n",
      "because he’s handsome, Nelly, but because he’s more myself than I am.\n",
      "Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton’s\n",
      "is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ere this speech ended I became sensible of Heathcliff’s presence.\n",
      "Having noticed a slight movement, I turned my head, and saw him rise\n",
      "from the bench, and steal out noiselessly. He had listened till he\n",
      "heard Catherine say it would degrade her to marry him, and then he\n",
      "stayed to hear no further. My companion, sitting on the ground, was\n",
      "prevented by the back of the settle from remarking his presence or\n",
      "departure; but I started, and bade her hush!\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?” she asked, gazing nervously round.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Joseph is here,” I answered, catching opportunely the roll of his\n",
      "cartwheels up the road; “and Heathcliff will come in with him. I’m not\n",
      "sure whether he were not at the door this moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, he couldn’t overhear me at the door!” said she. “Give me Hareton,\n",
      "while you get the supper, and when it is ready ask me to sup with you.\n",
      "I want to cheat my uncomfortable conscience, and be convinced that\n",
      "Heathcliff has no notion of these things. He has not, has he? He does\n",
      "not know what being in love is!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see no reason that he should not know, as well as you,” I returned;\n",
      "“and if _you_ are his choice, he’ll be the most unfortunate creature\n",
      "that ever was born! As soon as you become Mrs. Linton, he loses friend,\n",
      "and love, and all! Have you considered how you’ll bear the separation,\n",
      "and how he’ll bear to be quite deserted in the world? Because, Miss\n",
      "Catherine—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He quite deserted! we separated!” she exclaimed, with an accent of\n",
      "indignation. “Who is to separate us, pray? They’ll meet the fate of\n",
      "Milo! Not as long as I live, Ellen: for no mortal creature. Every\n",
      "Linton on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before I could\n",
      "consent to forsake Heathcliff. Oh, that’s not what I intend—that’s not\n",
      "what I mean! I shouldn’t be Mrs. Linton were such a price demanded!\n",
      "He’ll be as much to me as he has been all his lifetime. Edgar must\n",
      "shake off his antipathy, and tolerate him, at least. He will, when he\n",
      "learns my true feelings towards him. Nelly, I see now you think me a\n",
      "selfish wretch; but did it never strike you that if Heathcliff and I\n",
      "married, we should be beggars? whereas, if I marry Linton I can aid\n",
      "Heathcliff to rise, and place him out of my brother’s power.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With your husband’s money, Miss Catherine?” I asked. “You’ll find him\n",
      "not so pliable as you calculate upon: and, though I’m hardly a judge, I\n",
      "think that’s the worst motive you’ve given yet for being the wife of\n",
      "young Linton.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not,” retorted she; “it is the best! The others were the\n",
      "satisfaction of my whims: and for Edgar’s sake, too, to satisfy him.\n",
      "This is for the sake of one who comprehends in his person my feelings\n",
      "to Edgar and myself. I cannot express it; but surely you and everybody\n",
      "have a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond\n",
      "you. What were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained\n",
      "here? My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff’s miseries,\n",
      "and I watched and felt each from the beginning: my great thought in\n",
      "living is himself. If all else perished, and _he_ remained, _I_ should\n",
      "still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were\n",
      "annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I should not\n",
      "seem a part of it. My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods:\n",
      "time will change it, I’m well aware, as winter changes the trees. My\n",
      "love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of\n",
      "little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I _am_ Heathcliff! He’s\n",
      "always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always\n",
      "a pleasure to myself, but as my own being. So don’t talk of our\n",
      "separation again: it is impracticable; and—”\n",
      "\n",
      "She paused, and hid her face in the folds of my gown; but I jerked it\n",
      "forcibly away. I was out of patience with her folly!\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I can make any sense of your nonsense, Miss,” I said, “it only goes\n",
      "to convince me that you are ignorant of the duties you undertake in\n",
      "marrying; or else that you are a wicked, unprincipled girl. But trouble\n",
      "me with no more secrets: I’ll not promise to keep them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll keep that?” she asked, eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I’ll not promise,” I repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was about to insist, when the entrance of Joseph finished our\n",
      "conversation; and Catherine removed her seat to a corner, and nursed\n",
      "Hareton, while I made the supper. After it was cooked, my\n",
      "fellow-servant and I began to quarrel who should carry some to Mr.\n",
      "Hindley; and we didn’t settle it till all was nearly cold. Then we came\n",
      "to the agreement that we would let him ask, if he wanted any; for we\n",
      "feared particularly to go into his presence when he had been some time\n",
      "alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how isn’t that nowt comed in fro’ th’ field, be this time? What is\n",
      "he about? girt idle seeght!” demanded the old man, looking round for\n",
      "Heathcliff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll call him,” I replied. “He’s in the barn, I’ve no doubt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I went and called, but got no answer. On returning, I whispered to\n",
      "Catherine that he had heard a good part of what she said, I was sure;\n",
      "and told how I saw him quit the kitchen just as she complained of her\n",
      "brother’s conduct regarding him. She jumped up in a fine fright, flung\n",
      "Hareton on to the settle, and ran to seek for her friend herself; not\n",
      "taking leisure to consider why she was so flurried, or how her talk\n",
      "would have affected him. She was absent such a while that Joseph\n",
      "proposed we should wait no longer. He cunningly conjectured they were\n",
      "staying away in order to avoid hearing his protracted blessing. They\n",
      "were “ill eneugh for ony fahl manners,” he affirmed. And on their\n",
      "behalf he added that night a special prayer to the usual\n",
      "quarter-of-an-hour’s supplication before meat, and would have tacked\n",
      "another to the end of the grace, had not his young mistress broken in\n",
      "upon him with a hurried command that he must run down the road, and,\n",
      "wherever Heathcliff had rambled, find and make him re-enter directly!\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want to speak to him, and I _must_, before I go upstairs,” she said.\n",
      "“And the gate is open: he is somewhere out of hearing; for he would not\n",
      "reply, though I shouted at the top of the fold as loud as I could.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joseph objected at first; she was too much in earnest, however, to\n",
      "suffer contradiction; and at last he placed his hat on his head, and\n",
      "walked grumbling forth. Meantime, Catherine paced up and down the\n",
      "floor, exclaiming—“I wonder where he is—I wonder where he _can_ be!\n",
      "What did I say, Nelly? I’ve forgotten. Was he vexed at my bad humour\n",
      "this afternoon? Dear! tell me what I’ve said to grieve him? I do wish\n",
      "he’d come. I do wish he would!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a noise for nothing!” I cried, though rather uneasy myself. “What\n",
      "a trifle scares you! It’s surely no great cause of alarm that\n",
      "Heathcliff should take a moonlight saunter on the moors, or even lie\n",
      "too sulky to speak to us in the hay-loft. I’ll engage he’s lurking\n",
      "there. See if I don’t ferret him out!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I departed to renew my search; its result was disappointment, and\n",
      "Joseph’s quest ended in the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yon lad gets war und war!” observed he on re-entering. “He’s left th’\n",
      "gate at t’ full swing, and Miss’s pony has trodden dahn two rigs o’\n",
      "corn, and plottered through, raight o’er into t’ meadow! Hahsomdiver,\n",

      "of his heead for nowt!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you found Heathcliff, you ass?” interrupted Catherine. “Have you\n",
      "been looking for him, as I ordered?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I sud more likker look for th’ horse,” he replied. “It ’ud be to more\n",
      "sense. Bud I can look for norther horse nur man of a neeght loike\n",

      "_my_ whistle—happen he’ll be less hard o’ hearing wi’ _ye_!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It _was_ a very dark evening for summer: the clouds appeared inclined\n",
      "to thunder, and I said we had better all sit down; the approaching rain\n",
      "would be certain to bring him home without further trouble. However,\n",
      "Catherine would not be persuaded into tranquillity. She kept wandering\n",
      "to and fro, from the gate to the door, in a state of agitation which\n",
      "permitted no repose; and at length took up a permanent situation on one\n",
      "side of the wall, near the road: where, heedless of my expostulations\n",
      "and the growling thunder, and the great drops that began to plash\n",
      "around her, she remained, calling at intervals, and then listening, and\n",
      "then crying outright. She beat Hareton, or any child, at a good\n",
      "passionate fit of crying.\n",
      "\n",
      "About midnight, while we still sat up, the storm came rattling over the\n",
      "Heights in full fury. There was a violent wind, as well as thunder, and\n",
      "either one or the other split a tree off at the corner of the building:\n",
      "a huge bough fell across the roof, and knocked down a portion of the\n",
      "east chimney-stack, sending a clatter of stones and soot into the\n",
      "kitchen-fire. We thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us; and\n",
      "Joseph swung on to his knees, beseeching the Lord to remember the\n",
      "patriarchs Noah and Lot, and, as in former times, spare the righteous,\n",
      "though he smote the ungodly. I felt some sentiment that it must be a\n",
      "judgment on us also. The Jonah, in my mind, was Mr. Earnshaw; and I\n",
      "shook the handle of his den that I might ascertain if he were yet\n",
      "living. He replied audibly enough, in a fashion which made my companion\n",
      "vociferate, more clamorously than before, that a wide distinction might\n",
      "be drawn between saints like himself and sinners like his master. But\n",
      "the uproar passed away in twenty minutes, leaving us all unharmed;\n",
      "excepting Cathy, who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in\n",
      "refusing to take shelter, and standing bonnetless and shawlless to\n",
      "catch as much water as she could with her hair and clothes. She came in\n",
      "and lay down on the settle, all soaked as she was, turning her face to\n",
      "the back, and putting her hands before it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Miss!” I exclaimed, touching her shoulder; “you are not bent on\n",
      "getting your death, are you? Do you know what o’clock it is? Half-past\n",
      "twelve. Come, come to bed! there’s no use waiting any longer on that\n",
      "foolish boy: he’ll be gone to Gimmerton, and he’ll stay there now. He\n",
      "guesses we shouldn’t wait for him till this late hour: at least, he\n",
      "guesses that only Mr. Hindley would be up; and he’d rather avoid having\n",
      "the door opened by the master.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay, nay, he’s noan at Gimmerton,” said Joseph. “I’s niver wonder but\n",
      "he’s at t’ bothom of a bog-hoile. This visitation worn’t for nowt, and\n",
      "I wod hev’ ye to look out, Miss—yah muh be t’ next. Thank Hivin for\n",
      "all! All warks togither for gooid to them as is chozzen, and piked out\n",
      "fro’ th’ rubbidge! Yah knaw whet t’ Scripture ses.” And he began\n",
      "quoting several texts, referring us to chapters and verses where we\n",
      "might find them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I, having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her wet\n",
      "things, left him preaching and her shivering, and betook myself to bed\n",
      "with little Hareton, who slept as fast as if everyone had been sleeping\n",
      "round him. I heard Joseph read on a while afterwards; then I\n",
      "distinguished his slow step on the ladder, and then I dropped asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming down somewhat later than usual, I saw, by the sunbeams piercing\n",
      "the chinks of the shutters, Miss Catherine still seated near the\n",
      "fireplace. The house-door was ajar, too; light entered from its\n",
      "unclosed windows; Hindley had come out, and stood on the kitchen\n",
      "hearth, haggard and drowsy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What ails you, Cathy?” he was saying when I entered: “you look as\n",
      "dismal as a drowned whelp. Why are you so damp and pale, child?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve been wet,” she answered reluctantly, “and I’m cold, that’s all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, she is naughty!” I cried, perceiving the master to be tolerably\n",
      "sober. “She got steeped in the shower of yesterday evening, and there\n",
      "she has sat the night through, and I couldn’t prevail on her to stir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Earnshaw stared at us in surprise. “The night through,” he\n",
      "repeated. “What kept her up? not fear of the thunder, surely? That was\n",
      "over hours since.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither of us wished to mention Heathcliff’s absence, as long as we\n",
      "could conceal it; so I replied, I didn’t know how she took it into her\n",
      "head to sit up; and she said nothing. The morning was fresh and cool; I\n",
      "threw back the lattice, and presently the room filled with sweet scents\n",
      "from the garden; but Catherine called peevishly to me, “Ellen, shut the\n",
      "window. I’m starving!” And her teeth chattered as she shrank closer to\n",
      "the almost extinguished embers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s ill,” said Hindley, taking her wrist; “I suppose that’s the\n",
      "reason she would not go to bed. Damn it! I don’t want to be troubled\n",
      "with more sickness here. What took you into the rain?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Running after t’ lads, as usuald!” croaked Joseph, catching an\n",
      "opportunity from our hesitation to thrust in his evil tongue. “If I war\n",
      "yah, maister, I’d just slam t’ boards i’ their faces all on ’em, gentle\n",

      "sneaking hither; and Miss Nelly, shoo’s a fine lass! shoo sits watching\n",
      "for ye i’ t’ kitchen; and as yah’re in at one door, he’s out at\n",

      "blind; but I’m noan: nowt ut t’ soart!—I seed young Linton boath coming\n",

      "“Silence, eavesdropper!” cried Catherine; “none of your insolence\n",
      "before me! Edgar Linton came yesterday by chance, Hindley; and it was\n",
      "_I_ who told him to be off: because I knew you would not like to have\n",
      "met him as you were.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You lie, Cathy, no doubt,” answered her brother, “and you are a\n",

      "you not with Heathcliff last night? Speak the truth, now. You need not\n",
      "be afraid of harming him: though I hate him as much as ever, he did me\n",
      "a good turn a short time since that will make my conscience tender of\n",
      "breaking his neck. To prevent it, I shall send him about his business\n",
      "this very morning; and after he’s gone, I’d advise you all to look\n",
      "sharp: I shall only have the more humour for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never saw Heathcliff last night,” answered Catherine, beginning to\n",
      "sob bitterly: “and if you do turn him out of doors, I’ll go with him.\n",
      "But, perhaps, you’ll never have an opportunity: perhaps, he’s gone.”\n",
      "Here she burst into uncontrollable grief, and the remainder of her\n",
      "words were inarticulate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse, and bade her get\n",
      "to her room immediately, or she shouldn’t cry for nothing! I obliged\n",
      "her to obey; and I shall never forget what a scene she acted when we\n",
      "reached her chamber: it terrified me. I thought she was going mad, and\n",
      "I begged Joseph to run for the doctor. It proved the commencement of\n",
      "delirium: Mr. Kenneth, as soon as he saw her, pronounced her\n",

      "were no better, and though our patient was as wearisome and headstrong\n",
      "as a patient could be, she weathered it through. Old Mrs. Linton paid\n",
      "us several visits, to be sure, and set things to rights, and scolded\n",
      "and ordered us all; and when Catherine was convalescent, she insisted\n",
      "on conveying her to Thrushcross Grange: for which deliverance we were\n",

      "Our young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate, and\n",
      "haughtier than ever. Heathcliff had never been heard of since the\n",

      "she had provoked me exceedingly, to lay the blame of his disappearance\n",

      "for several months, she ceased to hold any communication with me, save\n",
      "in the relation of a mere servant. Joseph fell under a ban also: he\n",
      "_would_ speak his mind, and lecture her all the same as if she were a\n",
      "little girl; and she esteemed herself a woman, and our mistress, and\n",
      "thought that her recent illness gave her a claim to be treated with\n",
      "consideration. Then the doctor had said that she would not bear\n",
      "crossing much; she ought to have her own way; and it was nothing less\n",
      "than murder in her eyes for any one to presume to stand up and\n",
      "contradict her. From Mr. Earnshaw and his companions she kept aloof;\n",
      "and tutored by Kenneth, and serious threats of a fit that often\n",
      "attended her rages, her brother allowed her whatever she pleased to\n",
      "demand, and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper. He was\n",
      "rather _too_ indulgent in humouring her caprices; not from affection,\n",
      "but from pride: he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the\n",
      "family by an alliance with the Lintons, and as long as she let him\n",
      "alone she might trample on us like slaves, for aught he cared! Edgar\n",

      "looked over the high wall of the court, causing undefined shadows to\n",
      "lurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the\n",
      "building. I set my burden on the house-steps by the kitchen-door, and\n",
      "lingered to rest, and drew in a few more breaths of the soft, sweet\n",
      "air; my eyes were on the moon, and my back to the entrance, when I\n",

      "and I had seen nobody on approaching the steps. Something stirred in\n",
      "the porch; and, moving nearer, I distinguished a tall man dressed in\n",
      "dark clothes, with dark face and hair. He leant against the side, and\n",
      "held his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself. “Who\n",
      "can it be?” I thought. “Mr. Earnshaw? Oh, no! The voice has no\n",
      "resemblance to his.”\n",

      "A ray fell on his features; the cheeks were sallow, and half covered\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yes, Heathcliff,” he replied, glancing from me up to the windows,\n",
      "which reflected a score of glittering moons, but showed no lights from\n",
      "within. “Are they at home? where is she? Nelly, you are not glad! you\n",
      "needn’t be so disturbed. Is she here? Speak! I want to have one word\n",
      "with her—your mistress. Go, and say some person from Gimmerton desires\n",
      "to see her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How will she take it?” I exclaimed. “What will she do? The surprise\n",
      "bewilders me—it will put her out of her head! And you _are_ Heathcliff!\n",

      "He lifted the latch, and I entered; but when I got to the parlour where\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Linton were, I could not persuade myself to proceed. At\n",
      "length I resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the\n",
      "candles lighted, and I opened the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "They sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall,\n",
      "and displayed, beyond the garden trees, and the wild green park, the\n",
      "valley of Gimmerton, with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top\n",
      "(for very soon after you pass the chapel, as you may have noticed, the\n",
      "sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of\n",
      "the glen). Wuthering Heights rose above this silvery vapour; but our\n",
      "old house was invisible; it rather dips down on the other side. Both\n",
      "the room and its occupants, and the scene they gazed on, looked\n",
      "wondrously peaceful. I shrank reluctantly from performing my errand;\n",
      "and was actually going away leaving it unsaid, after having put my\n",
      "question about the candles, when a sense of my folly compelled me to\n",
      "return, and mutter, “A person from Gimmerton wishes to see you ma’am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What does he want?” asked Mrs. Linton.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I did not question him,” I answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, close the curtains, Nelly,” she said; “and bring up tea. I’ll be\n",
      "back again directly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She quitted the apartment; Mr. Edgar inquired, carelessly, who it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some one mistress does not expect,” I replied. “That Heathcliff—you\n",
      "recollect him, sir—who used to live at Mr. Earnshaw’s.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What! the gipsy—the ploughboy?” he cried. “Why did you not say so to\n",
      "Catherine?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush! you must not call him by those names, master,” I said. “She’d be\n",
      "sadly grieved to hear you. She was nearly heartbroken when he ran off.\n",
      "I guess his return will make a jubilee to her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that\n",
      "overlooked the court. He unfastened it, and leant out. I suppose they\n",
      "were below, for he exclaimed quickly: “Don’t stand there, love! Bring\n",
      "the person in, if it be anyone particular.” Ere long, I heard the click\n",
      "of the latch, and Catherine flew upstairs, breathless and wild; too\n",
      "excited to show gladness: indeed, by her face, you would rather have\n",
      "surmised an awful calamity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Edgar, Edgar!” she panted, flinging her arms round his neck. “Oh,\n",
      "Edgar darling! Heathcliff’s come back—he is!” And she tightened her\n",
      "embrace to a squeeze.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well,” cried her husband, crossly, “don’t strangle me for that!\n",
      "He never struck me as such a marvellous treasure. There is no need to\n",
      "be frantic!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know you didn’t like him,” she answered, repressing a little the\n",
      "intensity of her delight. “Yet, for my sake, you must be friends now.\n",
      "Shall I tell him to come up?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here,” he said, “into the parlour?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where else?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for\n",
      "him. Mrs. Linton eyed him with a droll expression—half angry, half\n",
      "laughing at his fastidiousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” she added, after a while; “I cannot sit in the kitchen. Set two\n",
      "tables here, Ellen: one for your master and Miss Isabella, being\n",
      "gentry; the other for Heathcliff and myself, being of the lower orders.\n",
      "Will that please you, dear? Or must I have a fire lighted elsewhere? If\n",
      "so, give directions. I’ll run down and secure my guest. I’m afraid the\n",
      "joy is too great to be real!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was about to dart off again; but Edgar arrested her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_You_ bid him step up,” he said, addressing me; “and, Catherine, try\n",
      "to be glad, without being absurd. The whole household need not witness\n",
      "the sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I descended, and found Heathcliff waiting under the porch, evidently\n",
      "anticipating an invitation to enter. He followed my guidance without\n",
      "waste of words, and I ushered him into the presence of the master and\n",
      "mistress, whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking. But the\n",
      "lady’s glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the\n",
      "door: she sprang forward, took both his hands, and led him to Linton;\n",
      "and then she seized Linton’s reluctant fingers and crushed them into\n",
      "his. Now, fully revealed by the fire and candlelight, I was amazed,\n",
      "more than ever, to behold the transformation of Heathcliff. He had\n",
      "grown a tall, athletic, well-formed man; beside whom my master seemed\n",
      "quite slender and youth-like. His upright carriage suggested the idea\n",
      "of his having been in the army. His countenance was much older in\n",
      "expression and decision of feature than Mr. Linton’s; it looked\n",
      "intelligent, and retained no marks of former degradation. A\n",
      "half-civilised ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and eyes full\n",
      "of black fire, but it was subdued; and his manner was even dignified:\n",
      "quite divested of roughness, though too stern for grace. My master’s\n",
      "surprise equalled or exceeded mine: he remained for a minute at a loss\n",
      "how to address the ploughboy, as he had called him. Heathcliff dropped\n",
      "his slight hand, and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to\n",
      "speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sit down, sir,” he said, at length. “Mrs. Linton, recalling old times,\n",
      "would have me give you a cordial reception; and, of course, I am\n",
      "gratified when anything occurs to please her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I also,” answered Heathcliff, “especially if it be anything in\n",
      "which I have a part. I shall stay an hour or two willingly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her gaze fixed on him as if\n",
      "she feared he would vanish were she to remove it. He did not raise his\n",
      "to her often: a quick glance now and then sufficed; but it flashed\n",
      "back, each time more confidently, the undisguised delight he drank from\n",
      "hers. They were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer\n",
      "embarrassment. Not so Mr. Edgar: he grew pale with pure annoyance: a\n",
      "feeling that reached its climax when his lady rose, and stepping across\n",
      "the rug, seized Heathcliff’s hands again, and laughed like one beside\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall think it a dream to-morrow!” she cried. “I shall not be able\n",
      "to believe that I have seen, and touched, and spoken to you once more.\n",
      "And yet, cruel Heathcliff! you don’t deserve this welcome. To be absent\n",
      "and silent for three years, and never to think of me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A little more than you have thought of me,” he murmured. “I heard of\n",
      "your marriage, Cathy, not long since; and, while waiting in the yard\n",
      "below, I meditated this plan—just to have one glimpse of your face, a\n",
      "stare of surprise, perhaps, and pretended pleasure; afterwards settle\n",
      "my score with Hindley; and then prevent the law by doing execution on\n",
      "myself. Your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind; but beware of\n",
      "meeting me with another aspect next time! Nay, you’ll not drive me off\n",
      "again. You were really sorry for me, were you? Well, there was cause.\n",
      "I’ve fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice; and\n",
      "you must forgive me, for I struggled only for you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Catherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please to come to the\n",
      "table,” interrupted Linton, striving to preserve his ordinary tone, and\n",
      "a due measure of politeness. “Mr. Heathcliff will have a long walk,\n",
      "wherever he may lodge to-night; and I’m thirsty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She took her post before the urn; and Miss Isabella came, summoned by\n",
      "the bell; then, having handed their chairs forward, I left the room.\n",
      "The meal hardly endured ten minutes. Catherine’s cup was never filled:\n",
      "she could neither eat nor drink. Edgar had made a slop in his saucer,\n",
      "and scarcely swallowed a mouthful. Their guest did not protract his\n",
      "stay that evening above an hour longer. I asked, as he departed, if he\n",
      "went to Gimmerton?\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, to Wuthering Heights,” he answered: “Mr. Earnshaw invited me, when\n",
      "I called this morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Earnshaw invited _him_! and _he_ called on Mr. Earnshaw! I pondered\n",
      "this sentence painfully, after he was gone. Is he turning out a bit of\n",
      "a hypocrite, and coming into the country to work mischief under a\n",
      "cloak? I mused: I had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he\n",
      "had better have remained away.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the middle of the night, I was wakened from my first nap by Mrs.\n",
      "Linton gliding into my chamber, taking a seat on my bedside, and\n",
      "pulling me by the hair to rouse me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot rest, Ellen,” she said, by way of apology. “And I want some\n",
      "living creature to keep me company in my happiness! Edgar is sulky,\n",
      "because I’m glad of a thing that does not interest him: he refuses to\n",
      "open his mouth, except to utter pettish, silly speeches; and he\n",
      "affirmed I was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so\n",
      "sick and sleepy. He always contrives to be sick at the least cross! I\n",
      "gave a few sentences of commendation to Heathcliff, and he, either for\n",
      "a headache or a pang of envy, began to cry: so I got up and left him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What use is it praising Heathcliff to him?” I answered. “As lads they\n",
      "had an aversion to each other, and Heathcliff would hate just as much\n",
      "to hear him praised: it’s human nature. Let Mr. Linton alone about him,\n",
      "unless you would like an open quarrel between them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But does it not show great weakness?” pursued she. “I’m not envious: I\n",
      "never feel hurt at the brightness of Isabella’s yellow hair and the\n",
      "whiteness of her skin, at her dainty elegance, and the fondness all the\n",
      "family exhibit for her. Even you, Nelly, if we have a dispute\n",
      "sometimes, you back Isabella at once; and I yield like a foolish\n",
      "mother: I call her a darling, and flatter her into a good temper. It\n",
      "pleases her brother to see us cordial, and that pleases me. But they\n",
      "are very much alike: they are spoiled children, and fancy the world was\n",
      "made for their accommodation; and though I humour both, I think a smart\n",
      "chastisement might improve them all the same.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re mistaken, Mrs. Linton,” said I. “They humour you: I know what\n",
      "there would be to do if they did not. You can well afford to indulge\n",
      "their passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your\n",
      "desires. You may, however, fall out, at last, over something of equal\n",
      "consequence to both sides; and then those you term weak are very\n",
      "capable of being as obstinate as you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And then we shall fight to the death, sha’n’t we, Nelly?” she\n",
      "returned, laughing. “No! I tell you, I have such faith in Linton’s\n",
      "love, that I believe I might kill him, and he wouldn’t wish to\n",
      "retaliate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I advised her to value him the more for his affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do,” she answered, “but he needn’t resort to whining for trifles. It\n",
      "is childish; and, instead of melting into tears because I said that\n",
      "Heathcliff was now worthy of anyone’s regard, and it would honour the\n",
      "first gentleman in the country to be his friend, he ought to have said\n",
      "it for me, and been delighted from sympathy. He must get accustomed to\n",
      "him, and he may as well like him: considering how Heathcliff has reason\n",
      "to object to him, I’m sure he behaved excellently!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you think of his going to Wuthering Heights?” I inquired. “He\n",
      "is reformed in every respect, apparently: quite a Christian: offering\n",
      "the right hand of fellowship to his enemies all around!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He explained it,” she replied. “I wonder as much as you. He said he\n",
      "called to gather information concerning me from you, supposing you\n",
      "resided there still; and Joseph told Hindley, who came out and fell to\n",
      "questioning him of what he had been doing, and how he had been living;\n",
      "and finally, desired him to walk in. There were some persons sitting at\n",
      "cards; Heathcliff joined them; my brother lost some money to him, and,\n",
      "finding him plentifully supplied, he requested that he would come again\n",
      "in the evening: to which he consented. Hindley is too reckless to\n",
      "select his acquaintance prudently: he doesn’t trouble himself to\n",
      "reflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has\n",
      "basely injured. But Heathcliff affirms his principal reason for\n",
      "resuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a wish to install\n",
      "himself in quarters at walking distance from the Grange, and an\n",
      "attachment to the house where we lived together; and likewise a hope\n",
      "that I shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than I could\n",
      "have if he settled in Gimmerton. He means to offer liberal payment for\n",
      "permission to lodge at the Heights; and doubtless my brother’s\n",
      "covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms: he was always greedy;\n",
      "though what he grasps with one hand he flings away with the other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in!” said I.\n",
      "“Have you no fear of the consequences, Mrs. Linton?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“None for my friend,” she replied: “his strong head will keep him from\n",
      "danger; a little for Hindley: but he can’t be made morally worse than\n",
      "he is; and I stand between him and bodily harm. The event of this\n",
      "evening has reconciled me to God and humanity! I had risen in angry\n",
      "rebellion against Providence. Oh, I’ve endured very, very bitter\n",
      "misery, Nelly! If that creature knew how bitter, he’d be ashamed to\n",
      "cloud its removal with idle petulance. It was kindness for him which\n",
      "induced me to bear it alone: had I expressed the agony I frequently\n",
      "felt, he would have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently\n",
      "as I. However, it’s over, and I’ll take no revenge on his folly; I can\n",
      "afford to suffer anything hereafter! Should the meanest thing alive\n",
      "slap me on the cheek, I’d not only turn the other, but I’d ask pardon\n",
      "for provoking it; and, as a proof, I’ll go make my peace with Edgar\n",
      "instantly. Good-night! I’m an angel!”\n",
      "\n",
      "In this self-complacent conviction she departed; and the success of her\n",
      "fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow: Mr. Linton had not only\n",
      "abjured his peevishness (though his spirits seemed still subdued by\n",
      "Catherine’s exuberance of vivacity), but he ventured no objection to\n",
      "her taking Isabella with her to Wuthering Heights in the afternoon; and\n",
      "she rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in\n",
      "return as made the house a paradise for several days; both master and\n",
      "servants profiting from the perpetual sunshine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heathcliff—Mr. Heathcliff I should say in future—used the liberty of\n",
      "visiting at Thrushcross Grange cautiously, at first: he seemed\n",
      "estimating how far its owner would bear his intrusion. Catherine, also,\n",
      "deemed it judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in\n",
      "receiving him; and he gradually established his right to be expected.\n",
      "He retained a great deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was\n",
      "remarkable; and that served to repress all startling demonstrations of\n",
      "feeling. My master’s uneasiness experienced a lull, and further\n",
      "circumstances diverted it into another channel for a space.\n",
      "\n",
      "His new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of\n",
      "Isabella Linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards\n",
      "the tolerated guest. She was at that time a charming young lady of\n",
      "eighteen; infantile in manners, though possessed of keen wit, keen\n",
      "feelings, and a keen temper, too, if irritated. Her brother, who loved\n",
      "her tenderly, was appalled at this fantastic preference. Leaving aside\n",
      "the degradation of an alliance with a nameless man, and the possible\n",
      "fact that his property, in default of heirs male, might pass into such\n",
      "a one’s power, he had sense to comprehend Heathcliff’s disposition: to\n",
      "know that, though his exterior was altered, his mind was unchangeable\n",
      "and unchanged. And he dreaded that mind: it revolted him: he shrank\n",
      "forebodingly from the idea of committing Isabella to its keeping. He\n",
      "would have recoiled still more had he been aware that her attachment\n",
      "rose unsolicited, and was bestowed where it awakened no reciprocation\n",
      "of sentiment; for the minute he discovered its existence he laid the\n",
      "blame on Heathcliff’s deliberate designing.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had all remarked, during some time, that Miss Linton fretted and\n",
      "pined over something. She grew cross and wearisome; snapping at and\n",
      "teasing Catherine continually, at the imminent risk of exhausting her\n",
      "limited patience. We excused her, to a certain extent, on the plea of\n",
      "ill-health: she was dwindling and fading before our eyes. But one day,\n",
      "when she had been peculiarly wayward, rejecting her breakfast,\n",
      "complaining that the servants did not do what she told them; that the\n",
      "mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house, and Edgar\n",
      "neglected her; that she had caught a cold with the doors being left\n",
      "open, and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her, with a\n",
      "hundred yet more frivolous accusations, Mrs. Linton peremptorily\n",
      "insisted that she should get to bed; and, having scolded her heartily,\n",
      "threatened to send for the doctor. Mention of Kenneth caused her to\n",
      "exclaim, instantly, that her health was perfect, and it was only\n",
      "Catherine’s harshness which made her unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can you say I am harsh, you naughty fondling?” cried the mistress,\n",
      "amazed at the unreasonable assertion. “You are surely losing your\n",
      "reason. When have I been harsh, tell me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yesterday,” sobbed Isabella, “and now!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yesterday!” said her sister-in-law. “On what occasion?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In our walk along the moor: you told me to ramble where I pleased,\n",
      "while you sauntered on with Mr. Heathcliff!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And that’s your notion of harshness?” said Catherine, laughing. “It\n",
      "was no hint that your company was superfluous; we didn’t care whether\n",
      "you kept with us or not; I merely thought Heathcliff’s talk would have\n",
      "nothing entertaining for your ears.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, no,” wept the young lady; “you wished me away, because you knew I\n",
      "liked to be there!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is she sane?” asked Mrs. Linton, appealing to me. “I’ll repeat our\n",
      "conversation, word for word, Isabella; and you point out any charm it\n",
      "could have had for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t mind the conversation,” she answered: “I wanted to be with—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well?” said Catherine, perceiving her hesitate to complete the\n",
      "sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With him: and I won’t be always sent off!” she continued, kindling up.\n",
      "“You are a dog in the manger, Cathy, and desire no one to be loved but\n",
      "yourself!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are an impertinent little monkey!” exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in\n",
      "surprise. “But I’ll not believe this idiocy! It is impossible that you\n",
      "can covet the admiration of Heathcliff—that you consider him an\n",
      "agreeable person! I hope I have misunderstood you, Isabella?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, you have not,” said the infatuated girl. “I love him more than\n",
      "ever you loved Edgar, and he might love me, if you would let him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wouldn’t be you for a kingdom, then!” Catherine declared,\n",
      "emphatically: and she seemed to speak sincerely. “Nelly, help me to\n",
      "convince her of her madness. Tell her what Heathcliff is: an\n",
      "unreclaimed creature, without refinement, without cultivation; an arid\n",
      "wilderness of furze and whinstone. I’d as soon put that little canary\n",
      "into the park on a winter’s day, as recommend you to bestow your heart\n",
      "on him! It is deplorable ignorance of his character, child, and nothing\n",
      "else, which makes that dream enter your head. Pray, don’t imagine that\n",
      "he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern\n",
      "exterior! He’s not a rough diamond—a pearl-containing oyster of a\n",
      "rustic: he’s a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man. I never say to him, ‘Let\n",
      "this or that enemy alone, because it would be ungenerous or cruel to\n",
      "harm them;’ I say, ‘Let them alone, because _I_ should hate them to be\n",
      "wronged:’ and he’d crush you like a sparrow’s egg, Isabella, if he\n",
      "found you a troublesome charge. I know he couldn’t love a Linton; and\n",
      "yet he’d be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations:\n",
      "avarice is growing with him a besetting sin. There’s my picture: and\n",
      "I’m his friend—so much so, that had he thought seriously to catch you,\n",
      "I should, perhaps, have held my tongue, and let you fall into his\n",
      "trap.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Linton regarded her sister-in-law with indignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For shame! for shame!” she repeated, angrily. “You are worse than\n",
      "twenty foes, you poisonous friend!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! you won’t believe me, then?” said Catherine. “You think I speak\n",
      "from wicked selfishness?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m certain you do,” retorted Isabella; “and I shudder at you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good!” cried the other. “Try for yourself, if that be your spirit: I\n",
      "have done, and yield the argument to your saucy insolence.”—\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I must suffer for her egotism!” she sobbed, as Mrs. Linton left\n",
      "the room. “All, all is against me: she has blighted my single\n",
      "consolation. But she uttered falsehoods, didn’t she? Mr. Heathcliff is\n",
      "not a fiend: he has an honourable soul, and a true one, or how could he\n",
      "remember her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Banish him from your thoughts, Miss,” I said. “He’s a bird of bad\n",
      "omen: no mate for you. Mrs. Linton spoke strongly, and yet I can’t\n",
      "contradict her. She is better acquainted with his heart than I, or any\n",
      "one besides; and she never would represent him as worse than he is.\n",
      "Honest people don’t hide their deeds. How has he been living? how has\n",
      "he got rich? why is he staying at Wuthering Heights, the house of a man\n",
      "whom he abhors? They say Mr. Earnshaw is worse and worse since he came.\n",
      "They sit up all night together continually, and Hindley has been\n",
      "borrowing money on his land, and does nothing but play and drink: I\n",
      "heard only a week ago—it was Joseph who told me—I met him at Gimmerton:\n",

      "pocket, and her fathur’s son gallops down t’ broad road, while he flees\n",
      "afore to oppen t’ pikes!’ Now, Miss Linton, Joseph is an old rascal,\n",
      "but no liar; and, if his account of Heathcliff’s conduct be true, you\n",
      "would never think of desiring such a husband, would you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are leagued with the rest, Ellen!” she replied. “I’ll not listen\n",
      "to your slanders. What malevolence you must have to wish to convince me\n",
      "that there is no happiness in the world!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself, or\n",
      "persevered in nursing it perpetually, I cannot say: she had little time\n",
      "to reflect. The day after, there was a justice-meeting at the next\n",
      "town; my master was obliged to attend; and Mr. Heathcliff, aware of his\n",
      "absence, called rather earlier than usual. Catherine and Isabella were\n",
      "sitting in the library, on hostile terms, but silent: the latter\n",
      "alarmed at her recent indiscretion, and the disclosure she had made of\n",
      "her secret feelings in a transient fit of passion; the former, on\n",
      "mature consideration, really offended with her companion; and, if she\n",
      "laughed again at her pertness, inclined to make it no laughing matter\n",
      "to _her_. She did laugh as she saw Heathcliff pass the window. I was\n",
      "sweeping the hearth, and I noticed a mischievous smile on her lips.\n",
      "Isabella, absorbed in her meditations, or a book, remained till the\n",
      "door opened; and it was too late to attempt an escape, which she would\n",
      "gladly have done had it been practicable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come in, that’s right!” exclaimed the mistress, gaily, pulling a chair\n",
      "to the fire. “Here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the\n",
      "ice between them; and you are the very one we should both of us choose.\n",
      "Heathcliff, I’m proud to show you, at last, somebody that dotes on you\n",
      "more than myself. I expect you to feel flattered. Nay, it’s not Nelly;\n",
      "don’t look at her! My poor little sister-in-law is breaking her heart\n",
      "by mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty. It lies in\n",
      "your own power to be Edgar’s brother! No, no, Isabella, you sha’n’t run\n",
      "off,” she continued, arresting, with feigned playfulness, the\n",
      "confounded girl, who had risen indignantly. “We were quarrelling like\n",
      "cats about you, Heathcliff; and I was fairly beaten in protestations of\n",
      "devotion and admiration: and, moreover, I was informed that if I would\n",
      "but have the manners to stand aside, my rival, as she will have herself\n",
      "to be, would shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever,\n",
      "and send my image into eternal oblivion!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Catherine!” said Isabella, calling up her dignity, and disdaining to\n",
      "struggle from the tight grasp that held her, “I’d thank you to adhere\n",
      "to the truth and not slander me, even in joke! Mr. Heathcliff, be kind\n",
      "enough to bid this friend of yours release me: she forgets that you and\n",
      "I are not intimate acquaintances; and what amuses her is painful to me\n",
      "beyond expression.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As the guest answered nothing, but took his seat, and looked thoroughly\n",
      "indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him, she turned\n",
      "and whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By no means!” cried Mrs. Linton in answer. “I won’t be named a dog in\n",
      "the manger again. You _shall_ stay: now then! Heathcliff, why don’t you\n",
      "evince satisfaction at my pleasant news? Isabella swears that the love\n",
      "Edgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you. I’m sure\n",
      "she made some speech of the kind; did she not, Ellen? And she has\n",
      "fasted ever since the day before yesterday’s walk, from sorrow and rage\n",
      "that I despatched her out of your society under the idea of its being\n",
      "unacceptable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think you belie her,” said Heathcliff, twisting his chair to face\n",
      "them. “She wishes to be out of my society now, at any rate!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And he stared hard at the object of discourse, as one might do at a\n",
      "strange repulsive animal: a centipede from the Indies, for instance,\n",
      "which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it\n",
      "raises. The poor thing couldn’t bear that; she grew white and red in\n",
      "rapid succession, and, while tears beaded her lashes, bent the strength\n",
      "of her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of Catherine; and\n",
      "perceiving that as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another\n",
      "closed down, and she could not remove the whole together, she began to\n",
      "make use of her nails; and their sharpness presently ornamented the\n",
      "detainer’s with crescents of red.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s a tigress!” exclaimed Mrs. Linton, setting her free, and\n",
      "shaking her hand with pain. “Begone, for God’s sake, and hide your\n",
      "vixen face! How foolish to reveal those talons to _him_. Can’t you\n",
      "fancy the conclusions he’ll draw? Look, Heathcliff! they are\n",
      "instruments that will do execution—you must beware of your eyes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d wrench them off her fingers, if they ever menaced me,” he\n",
      "answered, brutally, when the door had closed after her. “But what did\n",
      "you mean by teasing the creature in that manner, Cathy? You were not\n",
      "speaking the truth, were you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I assure you I was,” she returned. “She has been dying for your sake\n",
      "several weeks, and raving about you this morning, and pouring forth a\n",
      "deluge of abuse, because I represented your failings in a plain light,\n",
      "for the purpose of mitigating her adoration. But don’t notice it\n",
      "further: I wished to punish her sauciness, that’s all. I like her too\n",
      "well, my dear Heathcliff, to let you absolutely seize and devour her\n",
      "up.”\n",

      "Sometimes, while meditating on these things in solitude, I’ve got up in\n",
      "a sudden terror, and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the\n",
      "farm. I’ve persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how\n",
      "people talked regarding his ways; and then I’ve recollected his\n",
      "confirmed bad habits, and, hopeless of benefiting him, have flinched\n",
      "from re-entering the dismal house, doubting if I could bear to be taken\n",
      "at my word.\n",
      "\n",
      "One time I passed the old gate, going out of my way, on a journey to\n",
      "Gimmerton. It was about the period that my narrative has reached: a\n",
      "bright frosty afternoon; the ground bare, and the road hard and dry. I\n",
      "came to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your\n",
      "left hand; a rough sand-pillar, with the letters W. H. cut on its north\n",
      "side, on the east, G., and on the south-west, T. G. It serves as a\n",
      "guide-post to the Grange, the Heights, and village. The sun shone\n",
      "yellow on its grey head, reminding me of summer; and I cannot say why,\n",
      "but all at once a gush of child’s sensations flowed into my heart.\n",
      "Hindley and I held it a favourite spot twenty years before. I gazed\n",
      "long at the weather-worn block; and, stooping down, perceived a hole\n",
      "near the bottom still full of snail-shells and pebbles, which we were\n",
      "fond of storing there with more perishable things; and, as fresh as\n",
      "reality, it appeared that I beheld my early playmate seated on the\n",
      "withered turf: his dark, square head bent forward, and his little hand\n",
      "scooping out the earth with a piece of slate. “Poor Hindley!” I\n",
      "exclaimed, involuntarily. I started: my bodily eye was cheated into a\n",
      "momentary belief that the child lifted its face and stared straight\n",
      "into mine! It vanished in a twinkling; but immediately I felt an\n",
      "irresistible yearning to be at the Heights. Superstition urged me to\n",
      "comply with this impulse: supposing he should be dead! I thought—or\n",
      "should die soon!—supposing it were a sign of death! The nearer I got to\n",
      "the house the more agitated I grew; and on catching sight of it I\n",
      "trembled in every limb. The apparition had outstripped me: it stood\n",
      "looking through the gate. That was my first idea on observing an\n",
      "elf-locked, brown-eyed boy setting his ruddy countenance against the\n",
      "bars. Further reflection suggested this must be Hareton, _my_ Hareton,\n",
      "not altered greatly since I left him, ten months since.\n",
      "\n",
      "“God bless thee, darling!” I cried, forgetting instantaneously my\n",
      "foolish fears. “Hareton, it’s Nelly! Nelly, thy nurse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He retreated out of arm’s length, and picked up a large flint.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am come to see thy father, Hareton,” I added, guessing from the\n",
      "action that Nelly, if she lived in his memory at all, was not\n",
      "recognised as one with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "He raised his missile to hurl it; I commenced a soothing speech, but\n",
      "could not stay his hand: the stone struck my bonnet; and then ensued,\n",
      "from the stammering lips of the little fellow, a string of curses,\n",
      "which, whether he comprehended them or not, were delivered with\n",
      "practised emphasis, and distorted his baby features into a shocking\n",
      "expression of malignity. You may be certain this grieved more than\n",
      "angered me. Fit to cry, I took an orange from my pocket, and offered it\n",
      "to propitiate him. He hesitated, and then snatched it from my hold; as\n",
      "if he fancied I only intended to tempt and disappoint him. I showed\n",
      "another, keeping it out of his reach.\n",
      "\n",

      "He jumped at the fruit; I raised it higher. “What does he teach you?” I\n",
      "asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Naught,” said he, “but to keep out of his gait. Daddy cannot bide me,\n",
      "because I swear at him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?” I observed.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Who, then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heathcliff.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I asked if he liked Mr. Heathcliff.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay!” he answered again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Desiring to have his reasons for liking him, I could only gather the\n",
      "sentences—“I known’t: he pays dad back what he gies to me—he curses\n",
      "daddy for cursing me. He says I mun do as I will.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And the curate does not teach you to read and write, then?” I pursued.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I was told the curate should have his —— teeth dashed down his ——\n",
      "throat, if he stepped over the threshold—Heathcliff had promised that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I put the orange in his hand, and bade him tell his father that a woman\n",
      "called Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him, by the garden gate. He\n",
      "went up the walk, and entered the house; but, instead of Hindley,\n",
      "Heathcliff appeared on the door-stones; and I turned directly and ran\n",
      "down the road as hard as ever I could race, making no halt till I\n",
      "gained the guide-post, and feeling as scared as if I had raised a\n",
      "goblin. This is not much connected with Miss Isabella’s affair: except\n",
      "that it urged me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard, and\n",
      "doing my utmost to check the spread of such bad influence at the\n",
      "Grange: even though I should wake a domestic storm, by thwarting Mrs.\n",
      "Linton’s pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next time Heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some\n",
      "pigeons in the court. She had never spoken a word to her sister-in-law\n",
      "for three days; but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining,\n",
      "and we found it a great comfort. Heathcliff had not the habit of\n",
      "bestowing a single unnecessary civility on Miss Linton, I knew. Now, as\n",
      "soon as he beheld her, his first precaution was to take a sweeping\n",
      "survey of the house-front. I was standing by the kitchen-window, but I\n",
      "drew out of sight. He then stepped across the pavement to her, and said\n",
      "something: she seemed embarrassed, and desirous of getting away; to\n",
      "prevent it, he laid his hand on her arm. She averted her face: he\n",
      "apparently put some question which she had no mind to answer. There was\n",
      "another rapid glance at the house, and supposing himself unseen, the\n",
      "scoundrel had the impudence to embrace her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Judas! Traitor!” I ejaculated. “You are a hypocrite, too, are you? A\n",
      "deliberate deceiver.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is, Nelly?” said Catherine’s voice at my elbow: I had been\n",
      "over-intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your worthless friend!” I answered, warmly: “the sneaking rascal\n",
      "yonder. Ah, he has caught a glimpse of us—he is coming in! I wonder\n",
      "will he have the heart to find a plausible excuse for making love to\n",
      "Miss, when he told you he hated her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Linton saw Isabella tear herself free, and run into the garden;\n",
      "and a minute after, Heathcliff opened the door. I couldn’t withhold\n",
      "giving some loose to my indignation; but Catherine angrily insisted on\n",
      "silence, and threatened to order me out of the kitchen, if I dared to\n",
      "be so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To hear you, people might think you were the mistress!” she cried.\n",
      "“You want setting down in your right place! Heathcliff, what are you\n",
      "about, raising this stir? I said you must let Isabella alone!—I beg you\n",
      "will, unless you are tired of being received here, and wish Linton to\n",
      "draw the bolts against you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“God forbid that he should try!” answered the black villain. I detested\n",
      "him just then. “God keep him meek and patient! Every day I grow madder\n",
      "after sending him to heaven!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush!” said Catherine, shutting the inner door. “Don’t vex me. Why\n",
      "have you disregarded my request? Did she come across you on purpose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it to you?” he growled. “I have a right to kiss her, if she\n",
      "chooses; and you have no right to object. I am not _your_ husband:\n",
      "_you_ needn’t be jealous of me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m not jealous of you,” replied the mistress; “I’m jealous for you.\n",
      "Clear your face: you sha’n’t scowl at me! If you like Isabella, you\n",
      "shall marry her. But do you like her? Tell the truth, Heathcliff!\n",
      "There, you won’t answer. I’m certain you don’t.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying that man?” I\n",
      "inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Linton should approve,” returned my lady, decisively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He might spare himself the trouble,” said Heathcliff: “I could do as\n",
      "well without his approbation. And as to you, Catherine, I have a mind\n",
      "to speak a few words now, while we are at it. I want you to be aware\n",
      "that I _know_ you have treated me infernally—infernally! Do you hear?\n",
      "And if you flatter yourself that I don’t perceive it, you are a fool;\n",
      "and if you think I can be consoled by sweet words, you are an idiot:\n",
      "and if you fancy I’ll suffer unrevenged, I’ll convince you of the\n",
      "contrary, in a very little while! Meantime, thank you for telling me\n",
      "your sister-in-law’s secret: I swear I’ll make the most of it. And\n",
      "stand you aside!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What new phase of his character is this?” exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in\n",
      "amazement. “I’ve treated you infernally—and you’ll take your revenge!\n",
      "How will you take it, ungrateful brute? How have I treated you\n",
      "infernally?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I seek no revenge on you,” replied Heathcliff, less vehemently.\n",
      "“That’s not the plan. The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don’t\n",
      "turn against him; they crush those beneath them. You are welcome to\n",
      "torture me to death for your amusement, only allow me to amuse myself a\n",
      "little in the same style, and refrain from insult as much as you are\n",
      "able. Having levelled my palace, don’t erect a hovel and complacently\n",
      "admire your own charity in giving me that for a home. If I imagined you\n",
      "really wished me to marry Isabel, I’d cut my throat!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, the evil is that I am _not_ jealous, is it?” cried Catherine.\n",
      "“Well, I won’t repeat my offer of a wife: it is as bad as offering\n",
      "Satan a lost soul. Your bliss lies, like his, in inflicting misery. You\n",
      "prove it. Edgar is restored from the ill-temper he gave way to at your\n",
      "coming; I begin to be secure and tranquil; and you, restless to know us\n",
      "at peace, appear resolved on exciting a quarrel. Quarrel with Edgar, if\n",
      "you please, Heathcliff, and deceive his sister: you’ll hit on exactly\n",
      "the most efficient method of revenging yourself on me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation ceased. Mrs. Linton sat down by the fire, flushed and\n",
      "gloomy. The spirit which served her was growing intractable: she could\n",
      "neither lay nor control it. He stood on the hearth with folded arms,\n",
      "brooding on his evil thoughts; and in this position I left them to seek\n",
      "the master, who was wondering what kept Catherine below so long.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ellen,” said he, when I entered, “have you seen your mistress?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; she’s in the kitchen, sir,” I answered. “She’s sadly put out by\n",
      "Mr. Heathcliff’s behaviour: and, indeed, I do think it’s time to\n",
      "arrange his visits on another footing. There’s harm in being too soft,\n",
      "and now it’s come to this—.” And I related the scene in the court, and,\n",
      "as near as I dared, the whole subsequent dispute. I fancied it could\n",
      "not be very prejudicial to Mrs. Linton; unless she made it so\n",
      "afterwards, by assuming the defensive for her guest. Edgar Linton had\n",
      "difficulty in hearing me to the close. His first words revealed that he\n",
      "did not clear his wife of blame.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is insufferable!” he exclaimed. “It is disgraceful that she\n",
      "should own him for a friend, and force his company on me! Call me two\n",
      "men out of the hall, Ellen. Catherine shall linger no longer to argue\n",
      "with the low ruffian—I have humoured her enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage, went,\n",
      "followed by me, to the kitchen. Its occupants had recommenced their\n",
      "angry discussion: Mrs. Linton, at least, was scolding with renewed\n",
      "vigour; Heathcliff had moved to the window, and hung his head, somewhat\n",
      "cowed by her violent rating apparently. He saw the master first, and\n",
      "made a hasty motion that she should be silent; which she obeyed,\n",
      "abruptly, on discovering the reason of his intimation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How is this?” said Linton, addressing her; “what notion of propriety\n",
      "must you have to remain here, after the language which has been held to\n",
      "you by that blackguard? I suppose, because it is his ordinary talk you\n",
      "think nothing of it: you are habituated to his baseness, and, perhaps,\n",
      "imagine I can get used to it too!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?” asked the mistress, in a\n",
      "tone particularly calculated to provoke her husband, implying both\n",
      "carelessness and contempt of his irritation. Heathcliff, who had raised\n",
      "his eyes at the former speech, gave a sneering laugh at the latter; on\n",
      "purpose, it seemed, to draw Mr. Linton’s attention to him. He\n",
      "succeeded; but Edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high\n",
      "flights of passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve been so far forbearing with you, sir,” he said quietly; “not that\n",
      "I was ignorant of your miserable, degraded character, but I felt you\n",
      "were only partly responsible for that; and Catherine wishing to keep up\n",
      "your acquaintance, I acquiesced—foolishly. Your presence is a moral\n",
      "poison that would contaminate the most virtuous: for that cause, and to\n",
      "prevent worse consequences, I shall deny you hereafter admission into\n",
      "this house, and give notice now that I require your instant departure.\n",
      "Three minutes’ delay will render it involuntary and ignominious.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye\n",
      "full of derision.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!” he said. “It is in\n",
      "danger of splitting its skull against my knuckles. By God! Mr. Linton,\n",
      "I’m mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down!”\n",
      "\n",
      "My master glanced towards the passage, and signed me to fetch the men:\n",
      "he had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter. I obeyed the\n",
      "hint; but Mrs. Linton, suspecting something, followed; and when I\n",
      "attempted to call them, she pulled me back, slammed the door to, and\n",
      "locked it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fair means!” she said, in answer to her husband’s look of angry\n",
      "surprise. “If you have not courage to attack him, make an apology, or\n",
      "allow yourself to be beaten. It will correct you of feigning more\n",
      "valour than you possess. No, I’ll swallow the key before you shall get\n",
      "it! I’m delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each! After constant\n",
      "indulgence of one’s weak nature, and the other’s bad one, I earn for\n",
      "thanks two samples of blind ingratitude, stupid to absurdity! Edgar, I\n",
      "was defending you and yours; and I wish Heathcliff may flog you sick,\n",
      "for daring to think an evil thought of me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the\n",
      "master. He tried to wrest the key from Catherine’s grasp, and for\n",
      "safety she flung it into the hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr.\n",
      "Edgar was taken with a nervous trembling, and his countenance grew\n",
      "deadly pale. For his life he could not avert that excess of emotion:\n",
      "mingled anguish and humiliation overcame him completely. He leant on\n",
      "the back of a chair, and covered his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, heavens! In old days this would win you knighthood!” exclaimed\n",
      "Mrs. Linton. “We are vanquished! we are vanquished! Heathcliff would as\n",
      "soon lift a finger at you as the king would march his army against a\n",
      "colony of mice. Cheer up! you sha’n’t be hurt! Your type is not a lamb,\n",
      "it’s a sucking leveret.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward, Cathy!” said her friend. “I\n",
      "compliment you on your taste. And that is the slavering, shivering\n",
      "thing you preferred to me! I would not strike him with my fist, but I’d\n",
      "kick him with my foot, and experience considerable satisfaction. Is he\n",
      "weeping, or is he going to faint for fear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The fellow approached and gave the chair on which Linton rested a push.\n",
      "He’d better have kept his distance: my master quickly sprang erect, and\n",
      "struck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a\n",
      "slighter man. It took his breath for a minute; and while he choked, Mr.\n",
      "Linton walked out by the back door into the yard, and from thence to\n",
      "the front entrance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There! you’ve done with coming here,” cried Catherine. “Get away, now;\n",
      "he’ll return with a brace of pistols and half-a-dozen assistants. If he\n",
      "did overhear us, of course he’d never forgive you. You’ve played me an\n",
      "ill turn, Heathcliff! But go—make haste! I’d rather see Edgar at bay\n",
      "than you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you suppose I’m going with that blow burning in my gullet?” he\n",
      "thundered. “By hell, no! I’ll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel-nut\n",

      "“He is not coming,” I interposed, framing a bit of a lie. “There’s the\n",
      "coachman and the two gardeners; you’ll surely not wait to be thrust\n",
      "into the road by them! Each has a bludgeon; and master will, very\n",
      "likely, be watching from the parlour-windows to see that they fulfil\n",
      "his orders.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The gardeners and coachman _were_ there: but Linton was with them. They\n",
      "had already entered the court. Heathcliff, on the second thoughts,\n",
      "resolved to avoid a struggle against three underlings: he seized the\n",
      "poker, smashed the lock from the inner door, and made his escape as\n",
      "they tramped in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Linton, who was very much excited, bade me accompany her upstairs.\n",
      "She did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance, and I was\n",
      "anxious to keep her in ignorance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m nearly distracted, Nelly!” she exclaimed, throwing herself on the\n",
      "sofa. “A thousand smiths’ hammers are beating in my head! Tell Isabella\n",
      "to shun me; this uproar is owing to her; and should she or any one else\n",
      "aggravate my anger at present, I shall get wild. And, Nelly, say to\n",
      "Edgar, if you see him again to-night, that I’m in danger of being\n",
      "seriously ill. I wish it may prove true. He has startled and distressed\n",
      "me shockingly! I want to frighten him. Besides, he might come and begin\n",
      "a string of abuse or complainings; I’m certain I should recriminate,\n",
      "and God knows where we should end! Will you do so, my good Nelly? You\n",
      "are aware that I am no way blamable in this matter. What possessed him\n",
      "to turn listener? Heathcliff’s talk was outrageous, after you left us;\n",
      "but I could soon have diverted him from Isabella, and the rest meant\n",
      "nothing. Now all is dashed wrong; by the fool’s craving to hear evil of\n",
      "self, that haunts some people like a demon! Had Edgar never gathered\n",
      "our conversation, he would never have been the worse for it. Really,\n",
      "when he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after I\n",
      "had scolded Heathcliff till I was hoarse for _him;_ I did not care\n",
      "hardly what they did to each other; especially as I felt that, however\n",
      "the scene closed, we should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how\n",
      "long! Well, if I cannot keep Heathcliff for my friend—if Edgar will be\n",
      "mean and jealous, I’ll try to break their hearts by breaking my own.\n",
      "That will be a prompt way of finishing all, when I am pushed to\n",
      "extremity! But it’s a deed to be reserved for a forlorn hope; I’d not\n",
      "take Linton by surprise with it. To this point he has been discreet in\n",
      "dreading to provoke me; you must represent the peril of quitting that\n",
      "policy, and remind him of my passionate temper, verging, when kindled,\n",
      "on frenzy. I wish you could dismiss that apathy out of that\n",
      "countenance, and look rather more anxious about me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The stolidity with which I received these instructions was, no doubt,\n",
      "rather exasperating: for they were delivered in perfect sincerity; but\n",
      "I believed a person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion\n",
      "to account, beforehand, might, by exerting her will, manage to control\n",
      "herself tolerably, even while under their influence; and I did not wish\n",
      "to “frighten” her husband, as she said, and multiply his annoyances for\n",
      "the purpose of serving her selfishness. Therefore I said nothing when I\n",
      "met the master coming towards the parlour; but I took the liberty of\n",
      "turning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel\n",
      "together. He began to speak first.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Remain where you are, Catherine,” he said; without any anger in his\n",
      "voice, but with much sorrowful despondency. “I shall not stay. I am\n",
      "neither come to wrangle nor be reconciled; but I wish just to learn\n",
      "whether, after this evening’s events, you intend to continue your\n",
      "intimacy with—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, for mercy’s sake,” interrupted the mistress, stamping her foot,\n",
      "“for mercy’s sake, let us hear no more of it now! Your cold blood\n",
      "cannot be worked into a fever: your veins are full of ice-water; but\n",
      "mine are boiling, and the sight of such chillness makes them dance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To get rid of me, answer my question,” persevered Mr. Linton. “You\n",
      "_must_ answer it; and that violence does not alarm me. I have found\n",
      "that you can be as stoical as anyone, when you please. Will you give up\n",
      "Heathcliff hereafter, or will you give up me? It is impossible for you\n",
      "to be _my_ friend and _his_ at the same time; and I absolutely\n",
      "_require_ to know which you choose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I require to be let alone!” exclaimed Catherine, furiously. “I demand\n",
      "it! Don’t you see I can scarcely stand? Edgar, you—you leave me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She rang the bell till it broke with a twang; I entered leisurely. It\n",
      "was enough to try the temper of a saint, such senseless, wicked rages!\n",
      "There she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa, and\n",
      "grinding her teeth, so that you might fancy she would crash them to\n",
      "splinters! Mr. Linton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and\n",
      "fear. He told me to fetch some water. She had no breath for speaking. I\n",
      "brought a glass full; and as she would not drink, I sprinkled it on her\n",
      "face. In a few seconds she stretched herself out stiff, and turned up\n",
      "her eyes, while her cheeks, at once blanched and livid, assumed the\n",
      "aspect of death. Linton looked terrified.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is nothing in the world the matter,” I whispered. I did not want\n",
      "him to yield, though I could not help being afraid in my heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She has blood on her lips!” he said, shuddering.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind!” I answered, tartly. And I told him how she had resolved,\n",
      "previous to his coming, on exhibiting a fit of frenzy. I incautiously\n",
      "gave the account aloud, and she heard me; for she started up—her hair\n",
      "flying over her shoulders, her eyes flashing, the muscles of her neck\n",
      "and arms standing out preternaturally. I made up my mind for broken\n",
      "bones, at least; but she only glared about her for an instant, and then\n",
      "rushed from the room. The master directed me to follow; I did, to her\n",
      "chamber-door: she hindered me from going further by securing it against\n",
      "me.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, I went to\n",
      "ask whether she would have some carried up. “No!” she replied,\n",
      "peremptorily. The same question was repeated at dinner and tea; and\n",
      "again on the morrow after, and received the same answer. Mr. Linton, on\n",
      "his part, spent his time in the library, and did not inquire concerning\n",
      "his wife’s occupations. Isabella and he had had an hour’s interview,\n",
      "during which he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper\n",
      "horror for Heathcliff’s advances: but he could make nothing of her\n",
      "evasive replies, and was obliged to close the examination\n",
      "unsatisfactorily; adding, however, a solemn warning, that if she were\n",
      "so insane as to encourage that worthless suitor, it would dissolve all\n",
      "bonds of relationship between herself and him.\n",

      "While Miss Linton moped about the park and garden, always silent, and\n",
      "almost always in tears; and her brother shut himself up among books\n",
      "that he never opened—wearying, I guessed, with a continual vague\n",
      "expectation that Catherine, repenting her conduct, would come of her\n",
      "own accord to ask pardon, and seek a reconciliation—and _she_ fasted\n",
      "pertinaciously, under the idea, probably, that at every meal Edgar was\n",
      "ready to choke for her absence, and pride alone held him from running\n",
      "to cast himself at her feet; I went about my household duties,\n",
      "convinced that the Grange had but one sensible soul in its walls, and\n",
      "that lodged in my body. I wasted no condolences on Miss, nor any\n",
      "expostulations on my mistress; nor did I pay much attention to the\n",
      "sighs of my master, who yearned to hear his lady’s name, since he might\n",
      "not hear her voice. I determined they should come about as they pleased\n",
      "for me; and though it was a tiresomely slow process, I began to rejoice\n",
      "at length in a faint dawn of its progress: as I thought at first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Linton, on the third day, unbarred her door, and having finished\n",
      "the water in her pitcher and decanter, desired a renewed supply, and a\n",
      "basin of gruel, for she believed she was dying. That I set down as a\n",
      "speech meant for Edgar’s ears; I believed no such thing, so I kept it\n",
      "to myself and brought her some tea and dry toast. She ate and drank\n",
      "eagerly, and sank back on her pillow again, clenching her hands and\n",
      "groaning. “Oh, I will die,” she exclaimed, “since no one cares anything\n",
      "about me. I wish I had not taken that.” Then a good while after I heard\n",
      "her murmur, “No, I’ll not die—he’d be glad—he does not love me at\n",
      "all—he would never miss me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you want anything, ma’am?” I inquired, still preserving my\n",
      "external composure, in spite of her ghastly countenance and strange,\n",
      "exaggerated manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is that apathetic being doing?” she demanded, pushing the thick\n",
      "entangled locks from her wasted face. “Has he fallen into a lethargy,\n",
      "or is he dead?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Neither,” replied I; “if you mean Mr. Linton. He’s tolerably well, I\n",
      "think, though his studies occupy him rather more than they ought: he is\n",
      "continually among his books, since he has no other society.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I should not have spoken so if I had known her true condition, but I\n",
      "could not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Among his books!” she cried, confounded. “And I dying! I on the brink\n",
      "of the grave! My God! does he know how I’m altered?” continued she,\n",
      "staring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the opposite\n",
      "wall. “Is that Catherine Linton? He imagines me in a pet—in play,\n",
      "perhaps. Cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest? Nelly, if\n",
      "it be not too late, as soon as I learn how he feels, I’ll choose\n",
      "between these two: either to starve at once—that would be no punishment\n",
      "unless he had a heart—or to recover, and leave the country. Are you\n",
      "speaking the truth about him now? Take care. Is he actually so utterly\n",
      "indifferent for my life?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, ma’am,” I answered, “the master has no idea of your being\n",
      "deranged; and of course he does not fear that you will let yourself die\n",
      "of hunger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You think not? Cannot you tell him I will?” she returned. “Persuade\n",

      "\n",
      "“No, you forget, Mrs. Linton,” I suggested, “that you have eaten some\n",

      "good effects.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I were only sure it would kill him,” she interrupted, “I’d kill\n",
      "myself directly! These three awful nights I’ve never closed my lids—and\n",
      "oh, I’ve been tormented! I’ve been haunted, Nelly! But I begin to fancy\n",
      "you don’t like me. How strange! I thought, though everybody hated and\n",
      "despised each other, they could not avoid loving me. And they have all\n",
      "turned to enemies in a few hours. _They_ have, I’m positive; the people\n",
      "_here_. How dreary to meet death, surrounded by their cold faces!\n",
      "Isabella, terrified and repelled, afraid to enter the room, it would be\n",
      "so dreadful to watch Catherine go. And Edgar standing solemnly by to\n",
      "see it over; then offering prayers of thanks to God for restoring peace\n",
      "to his house, and going back to his _books_! What in the name of all\n",
      "that feels has he to do with _books_, when I am dying?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She could not bear the notion which I had put into her head of Mr.\n",
      "Linton’s philosophical resignation. Tossing about, she increased her\n",
      "feverish bewilderment to madness, and tore the pillow with her teeth;\n",
      "then raising herself up all burning, desired that I would open the\n",
      "window. We were in the middle of winter, the wind blew strong from the\n",
      "north-east, and I objected. Both the expressions flitting over her\n",
      "face, and the changes of her moods, began to alarm me terribly; and\n",
      "brought to my recollection her former illness, and the doctor’s\n",
      "injunction that she should not be crossed. A minute previously she was\n",
      "violent; now, supported on one arm, and not noticing my refusal to obey\n",
      "her, she seemed to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from\n",
      "the rents she had just made, and ranging them on the sheet according to\n",
      "their different species: her mind had strayed to other associations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s a turkey’s,” she murmured to herself; “and this is a wild\n",
      "duck’s; and this is a pigeon’s. Ah, they put pigeons’ feathers in the\n",
      "pillows—no wonder I couldn’t die! Let me take care to throw it on the\n",
      "floor when I lie down. And here is a moor-cock’s; and this—I should\n",
      "know it among a thousand—it’s a lapwing’s. Bonny bird; wheeling over\n",
      "our heads in the middle of the moor. It wanted to get to its nest, for\n",
      "the clouds had touched the swells, and it felt rain coming. This\n",
      "feather was picked up from the heath, the bird was not shot: we saw its\n",
      "nest in the winter, full of little skeletons. Heathcliff set a trap\n",
      "over it, and the old ones dared not come. I made him promise he’d never\n",
      "shoot a lapwing after that, and he didn’t. Yes, here are more! Did he\n",
      "shoot my lapwings, Nelly? Are they red, any of them? Let me look.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give over with that baby-work!” I interrupted, dragging the pillow\n",
      "away, and turning the holes towards the mattress, for she was removing\n",
      "its contents by handfuls. “Lie down and shut your eyes: you’re\n",
      "wandering. There’s a mess! The down is flying about like snow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I went here and there collecting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see in you, Nelly,” she continued dreamily, “an aged woman: you have\n",
      "grey hair and bent shoulders. This bed is the fairy cave under\n",
      "Penistone Crags, and you are gathering elf-bolts to hurt our heifers;\n",
      "pretending, while I am near, that they are only locks of wool. That’s\n",
      "what you’ll come to fifty years hence: I know you are not so now. I’m\n",
      "not wandering: you’re mistaken, or else I should believe you really\n",
      "_were_ that withered hag, and I should think I _was_ under Penistone\n",
      "Crags; and I’m conscious it’s night, and there are two candles on the\n",
      "table making the black press shine like jet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The black press? where is that?” I asked. “You are talking in your\n",
      "sleep!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s against the wall, as it always is,” she replied. “It _does_\n",
      "appear odd—I see a face in it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no press in the room, and never was,” said I, resuming my\n",
      "seat, and looping up the curtain that I might watch her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t _you_ see that face?” she inquired, gazing earnestly at the\n",
      "mirror.\n",
      "\n",
      "And say what I could, I was incapable of making her comprehend it to be\n",
      "her own; so I rose and covered it with a shawl.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s behind there still!” she pursued, anxiously. “And it stirred. Who\n",
      "is it? I hope it will not come out when you are gone! Oh! Nelly, the\n",
      "room is haunted! I’m afraid of being alone!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I took her hand in mine, and bid her be composed; for a succession of\n",
      "shudders convulsed her frame, and she _would_ keep straining her gaze\n",
      "towards the glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s nobody here!” I insisted. “It was _yourself_, Mrs. Linton: you\n",
      "knew it a while since.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Myself!” she gasped, “and the clock is striking twelve! It’s true,\n",
      "then! that’s dreadful!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her fingers clutched the clothes, and gathered them over her eyes. I\n",
      "attempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her\n",
      "husband; but I was summoned back by a piercing shriek—the shawl had\n",
      "dropped from the frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, what _is_ the matter?” cried I. “Who is coward now? Wake up! That\n",
      "is the glass—the mirror, Mrs. Linton; and you see yourself in it, and\n",
      "there am I too by your side.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Trembling and bewildered, she held me fast, but the horror gradually\n",
      "passed from her countenance; its paleness gave place to a glow of\n",
      "shame.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, dear! I thought I was at home,” she sighed. “I thought I was lying\n",
      "in my chamber at Wuthering Heights. Because I’m weak, my brain got\n",
      "confused, and I screamed unconsciously. Don’t say anything; but stay\n",
      "with me. I dread sleeping: my dreams appal me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A sound sleep would do you good, ma’am,” I answered: “and I hope this\n",
      "suffering will prevent your trying starving again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, if I were but in my own bed in the old house!” she went on\n",
      "bitterly, wringing her hands. “And that wind sounding in the firs by\n",
      "the lattice. Do let me feel it—it comes straight down the moor—do let\n",
      "me have one breath!”\n",
      "\n",
      "To pacify her I held the casement ajar a few seconds. A cold blast\n",
      "rushed through; I closed it, and returned to my post. She lay still\n",
      "now, her face bathed in tears. Exhaustion of body had entirely subdued\n",
      "her spirit: our fiery Catherine was no better than a wailing child.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How long is it since I shut myself in here?” she asked, suddenly\n",
      "reviving.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was Monday evening,” I replied, “and this is Thursday night, or\n",
      "rather Friday morning, at present.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What! of the same week?” she exclaimed. “Only that brief time?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Long enough to live on nothing but cold water and ill-temper,”\n",
      "observed I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it seems a weary number of hours,” she muttered doubtfully: “it\n",
      "must be more. I remember being in the parlour after they had\n",
      "quarrelled, and Edgar being cruelly provoking, and me running into this\n",
      "room desperate. As soon as ever I had barred the door, utter blackness\n",
      "overwhelmed me, and I fell on the floor. I couldn’t explain to Edgar\n",
      "how certain I felt of having a fit, or going raging mad, if he\n",
      "persisted in teasing me! I had no command of tongue, or brain, and he\n",
      "did not guess my agony, perhaps: it barely left me sense to try to\n",
      "escape from him and his voice. Before I recovered sufficiently to see\n",
      "and hear, it began to be dawn, and, Nelly, I’ll tell you what I\n",
      "thought, and what has kept recurring and recurring till I feared for my\n",
      "reason. I thought as I lay there, with my head against that table leg,\n",
      "and my eyes dimly discerning the grey square of the window, that I was\n",
      "enclosed in the oak-panelled bed at home; and my heart ached with some\n",
      "great grief which, just waking, I could not recollect. I pondered, and\n",
      "worried myself to discover what it could be, and, most strangely, the\n",
      "whole last seven years of my life grew a blank! I did not recall that\n",
      "they had been at all. I was a child; my father was just buried, and my\n",
      "misery arose from the separation that Hindley had ordered between me\n",
      "and Heathcliff. I was laid alone, for the first time; and, rousing from\n",
      "a dismal doze after a night of weeping, I lifted my hand to push the\n",
      "panels aside: it struck the table-top! I swept it along the carpet, and\n",
      "then memory burst in: my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of\n",
      "despair. I cannot say why I felt so wildly wretched: it must have been\n",
      "temporary derangement; for there is scarcely cause. But, supposing at\n",
      "twelve years old I had been wrenched from the Heights, and every early\n",
      "association, and my all in all, as Heathcliff was at that time, and\n",
      "been converted at a stroke into Mrs. Linton, the lady of Thrushcross\n",
      "Grange, and the wife of a stranger: an exile, and outcast, thenceforth,\n",
      "from what had been my world. You may fancy a glimpse of the abyss where\n",
      "I grovelled! Shake your head as you will, Nelly, _you_ have helped to\n",

      "compelled him to leave me quiet! Oh, I’m burning! I wish I were out of\n",
      "doors! I wish I were a girl again, half savage and hardy, and free; and\n",
      "laughing at injuries, not maddening under them! Why am I so changed?\n",
      "why does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words? I’m sure I\n",
      "should be myself were I once among the heather on those hills. Open the\n",
      "window again wide: fasten it open! Quick, why don’t you move?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because I won’t give you your death of cold,” I answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You won’t give me a chance of life, you mean,” she said sullenly.\n",
      "“However, I’m not helpless yet; I’ll open it myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And sliding from the bed before I could hinder her, she crossed the\n",
      "room, walking very uncertainly, threw it back, and bent out, careless\n",
      "of the frosty air that cut about her shoulders as keen as a knife. I\n",
      "entreated, and finally attempted to force her to retire. But I soon\n",
      "found her delirious strength much surpassed mine (she _was_ delirious,\n",
      "I became convinced by her subsequent actions and ravings). There was no\n",
      "moon, and everything beneath lay in misty darkness: not a light gleamed\n",
      "from any house, far or near; all had been extinguished long ago: and\n",
      "those at Wuthering Heights were never visible—still she asserted she\n",
      "caught their shining.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look!” she cried eagerly, “that’s my room with the candle in it, and\n",
      "the trees swaying before it; and the other candle is in Joseph’s\n",
      "garret. Joseph sits up late, doesn’t he? He’s waiting till I come home\n",
      "that he may lock the gate. Well, he’ll wait a while yet. It’s a rough\n",
      "journey, and a sad heart to travel it; and we must pass by Gimmerton\n",
      "Kirk to go that journey! We’ve braved its ghosts often together, and\n",
      "dared each other to stand among the graves and ask them to come. But,\n",
      "Heathcliff, if I dare you now, will you venture? If you do, I’ll keep\n",
      "you. I’ll not lie there by myself: they may bury me twelve feet deep,\n",
      "and throw the church down over me, but I won’t rest till you are with\n",
      "me. I never will!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She paused, and resumed with a strange smile. “He’s considering—he’d\n",
      "rather I’d come to him! Find a way, then! not through that kirkyard.\n",
      "You are slow! Be content, you always followed me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Perceiving it vain to argue against her insanity, I was planning how I\n",
      "could reach something to wrap about her, without quitting my hold of\n",
      "herself (for I could not trust her alone by the gaping lattice), when,\n",
      "to my consternation, I heard the rattle of the door-handle, and Mr.\n",
      "Linton entered. He had only then come from the library; and, in passing\n",
      "through the lobby, had noticed our talking and been attracted by\n",
      "curiosity, or fear, to examine what it signified, at that late hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, sir!” I cried, checking the exclamation risen to his lips at the\n",
      "sight which met him, and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber. “My poor\n",
      "mistress is ill, and she quite masters me: I cannot manage her at all;\n",
      "pray, come and persuade her to go to bed. Forget your anger, for she’s\n",
      "hard to guide any way but her own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Catherine ill?” he said, hastening to us. “Shut the window, Ellen!\n",
      "Catherine! why—”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was silent. The haggardness of Mrs. Linton’s appearance smote him\n",
      "speechless, and he could only glance from her to me in horrified\n",
      "astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s been fretting here,” I continued, “and eating scarcely anything,\n",
      "and never complaining: she would admit none of us till this evening,\n",
      "and so we couldn’t inform you of her state, as we were not aware of it\n",
      "ourselves; but it is nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt I uttered my explanations awkwardly; the master frowned. “It is\n",
      "nothing, is it, Ellen Dean?” he said sternly. “You shall account more\n",
      "clearly for keeping me ignorant of this!” And he took his wife in his\n",
      "arms, and looked at her with anguish.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first she gave him no glance of recognition: he was invisible to her\n",
      "abstracted gaze. The delirium was not fixed, however; having weaned her\n",
      "eyes from contemplating the outer darkness, by degrees she centred her\n",
      "attention on him, and discovered who it was that held her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! you are come, are you, Edgar Linton?” she said, with angry\n",
      "animation. “You are one of those things that are ever found when least\n",
      "wanted, and when you are wanted, never! I suppose we shall have plenty\n",
      "of lamentations now—I see we shall—but they can’t keep me from my\n",
      "narrow home out yonder: my resting-place, where I’m bound before spring\n",
      "is over! There it is: not among the Lintons, mind, under the\n",
      "chapel-roof, but in the open air, with a head-stone; and you may please\n",
      "yourself whether you go to them or come to me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Catherine, what have you done?” commenced the master. “Am I nothing to\n",
      "you any more? Do you love that wretch Heath—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush!” cried Mrs. Linton. “Hush, this moment! You mention that name\n",
      "and I end the matter instantly by a spring from the window! What you\n",
      "touch at present you may have; but my soul will be on that hill-top\n",
      "before you lay hands on me again. I don’t want you, Edgar: I’m past\n",
      "wanting you. Return to your books. I’m glad you possess a consolation,\n",
      "for all you had in me is gone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Her mind wanders, sir,” I interposed. “She has been talking nonsense\n",
      "the whole evening; but let her have quiet, and proper attendance, and\n",
      "she’ll rally. Hereafter, we must be cautious how we vex her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I desire no further advice from you,” answered Mr. Linton. “You knew\n",
      "your mistress’s nature, and you encouraged me to harass her. And not to\n",
      "give me one hint of how she has been these three days! It was\n",
      "heartless! Months of sickness could not cause such a change!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I began to defend myself, thinking it too bad to be blamed for\n",
      "another’s wicked waywardness. “I knew Mrs. Linton’s nature to be\n",
      "headstrong and domineering,” cried I: “but I didn’t know that you\n",
      "wished to foster her fierce temper! I didn’t know that, to humour her,\n",
      "I should wink at Mr. Heathcliff. I performed the duty of a faithful\n",
      "servant in telling you, and I have got a faithful servant’s wages!\n",
      "Well, it will teach me to be careful next time. Next time you may\n",
      "gather intelligence for yourself!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service, Ellen\n",
      "Dean,” he replied.\n",

      "I. “Heathcliff has your permission to come a-courting to Miss, and to\n",

      "my hidden enemy. You witch! So you do seek elf-bolts to hurt us! Let me\n",
      "go, and I’ll make her rue! I’ll make her howl a recantation!”\n",
      "\n",
      "A maniac’s fury kindled under her brows; she struggled desperately to\n",
      "disengage herself from Linton’s arms. I felt no inclination to tarry\n",
      "the event; and, resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility,\n",
      "I quitted the chamber.\n",
      "\n",
      "In passing the garden to reach the road, at a place where a bridle hook\n",
      "is driven into the wall, I saw something white moved irregularly,\n",
      "evidently by another agent than the wind. Notwithstanding my hurry, I\n",
      "stayed to examine it, lest ever after I should have the conviction\n",
      "impressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world.\n",
      "My surprise and perplexity were great on discovering, by touch more\n",
      "than vision, Miss Isabella’s springer, Fanny, suspended by a\n",
      "handkerchief, and nearly at its last gasp. I quickly released the\n",
      "animal, and lifted it into the garden. I had seen it follow its\n",
      "mistress upstairs when she went to bed; and wondered much how it could\n",
      "have got out there, and what mischievous person had treated it so.\n",
      "While untying the knot round the hook, it seemed to me that I\n",
      "repeatedly caught the beat of horses’ feet galloping at some distance;\n",
      "but there were such a number of things to occupy my reflections that I\n",
      "hardly gave the circumstance a thought: though it was a strange sound,\n",
      "in that place, at two o’clock in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a\n",
      "patient in the village as I came up the street; and my account of\n",
      "Catherine Linton’s malady induced him to accompany me back immediately.\n",
      "He was a plain rough man; and he made no scruple to speak his doubts of\n",
      "her surviving this second attack; unless she were more submissive to\n",
      "his directions than she had shown herself before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nelly Dean,” said he, “I can’t help fancying there’s an extra cause\n",
      "for this. What has there been to do at the Grange? We’ve odd reports up\n",
      "here. A stout, hearty lass like Catherine does not fall ill for a\n",
      "trifle; and that sort of people should not either. It’s hard work\n",
      "bringing them through fevers, and such things. How did it begin?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The master will inform you,” I answered; “but you are acquainted with\n",
      "the Earnshaws’ violent dispositions, and Mrs. Linton caps them all. I\n",
      "may say this; it commenced in a quarrel. She was struck during a\n",
      "tempest of passion with a kind of fit. That’s her account, at least:\n",
      "for she flew off in the height of it, and locked herself up.\n",
      "Afterwards, she refused to eat, and now she alternately raves and\n",
      "remains in a half dream; knowing those about her, but having her mind\n",
      "filled with all sorts of strange ideas and illusions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Linton will be sorry?” observed Kenneth, interrogatively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sorry? he’ll break his heart should anything happen!” I replied.\n",
      "“Don’t alarm him more than necessary.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I told him to beware,” said my companion; “and he must bide the\n",

      "Heathcliff lately?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heathcliff frequently visits at the Grange,” answered I, “though more\n",
      "on the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy, than\n",
      "because the master likes his company. At present he’s discharged from\n",
      "the trouble of calling; owing to some presumptuous aspirations after\n",
      "Miss Linton which he manifested. I hardly think he’ll be taken in\n",
      "again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And does Miss Linton turn a cold shoulder on him?” was the doctor’s\n",
      "next question.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m not in her confidence,” returned I, reluctant to continue the\n",
      "subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, she’s a sly one,” he remarked, shaking his head. “She keeps her\n",
      "own counsel! But she’s a real little fool. I have it from good\n",
      "authority that last night (and a pretty night it was!) she and\n",
      "Heathcliff were walking in the plantation at the back of your house\n",
      "above two hours; and he pressed her not to go in again, but just mount\n",
      "his horse and away with him! My informant said she could only put him\n",
      "off by pledging her word of honour to be prepared on their first\n",
      "meeting after that: when it was to be he didn’t hear; but you urge Mr.\n",
      "Linton to look sharp!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This news filled me with fresh fears; I outstripped Kenneth, and ran\n",
      "most of the way back. The little dog was yelping in the garden yet. I\n",
      "spared a minute to open the gate for it, but instead of going to the\n",
      "house door, it coursed up and down snuffing the grass, and would have\n",
      "escaped to the road, had I not seized it and conveyed it in with me. On\n",
      "ascending to Isabella’s room, my suspicions were confirmed: it was\n",
      "empty. Had I been a few hours sooner Mrs. Linton’s illness might have\n",
      "arrested her rash step. But what could be done now? There was a bare\n",
      "possibility of overtaking them if pursued instantly. _I_ could not\n",
      "pursue them, however; and I dared not rouse the family, and fill the\n",
      "place with confusion; still less unfold the business to my master,\n",
      "absorbed as he was in his present calamity, and having no heart to\n",
      "spare for a second grief! I saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue,\n",
      "and suffer matters to take their course; and Kenneth being arrived, I\n",
      "went with a badly composed countenance to announce him. Catherine lay\n",
      "in a troubled sleep: her husband had succeeded in soothing the excess\n",
      "of frenzy; he now hung over her pillow, watching every shade and every\n",
      "change of her painfully expressive features.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor, on examining the case for himself, spoke hopefully to him\n",
      "of its having a favourable termination, if we could only preserve\n",
      "around her perfect and constant tranquillity. To me, he signified the\n",
      "threatening danger was not so much death, as permanent alienation of\n",
      "intellect.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not close my eyes that night, nor did Mr. Linton: indeed, we\n",
      "never went to bed; and the servants were all up long before the usual\n",
      "hour, moving through the house with stealthy tread, and exchanging\n",
      "whispers as they encountered each other in their vocations. Every one\n",
      "was active but Miss Isabella; and they began to remark how sound she\n",
      "slept: her brother, too, asked if she had risen, and seemed impatient\n",
      "for her presence, and hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her\n",
      "sister-in-law. I trembled lest he should send me to call her; but I was\n",
      "spared the pain of being the first proclaimant of her flight. One of\n",
      "the maids, a thoughtless girl, who had been on an early errand to\n",
      "Gimmerton, came panting upstairs, open-mouthed, and dashed into the\n",
      "chamber, crying: “Oh, dear, dear! What mun we have next? Master,\n",
      "master, our young lady—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold your noise!” cried I hastily, enraged at her clamorous manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Speak lower, Mary—What is the matter?” said Mr. Linton. “What ails\n",
      "your young lady?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s gone, she’s gone! Yon’ Heathcliff’s run off wi’ her!” gasped the\n",
      "girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is not true!” exclaimed Linton, rising in agitation. “It cannot\n",
      "be: how has the idea entered your head? Ellen Dean, go and seek her. It\n",
      "is incredible: it cannot be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he spoke he took the servant to the door, and then repeated his\n",
      "demand to know her reasons for such an assertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, I met on the road a lad that fetches milk here,” she stammered,\n",
      "“and he asked whether we weren’t in trouble at the Grange. I thought he\n",
      "meant for missis’s sickness, so I answered, yes. Then says he, ‘There’s\n",
      "somebody gone after ’em, I guess?’ I stared. He saw I knew nought about\n",
      "it, and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a horse’s\n",
      "shoe fastened at a blacksmith’s shop, two miles out of Gimmerton, not\n",
      "very long after midnight! and how the blacksmith’s lass had got up to\n",
      "spy who they were: she knew them both directly. And she noticed the\n",
      "man—Heathcliff it was, she felt certain: nob’dy could mistake him,\n",
      "besides—put a sovereign in her father’s hand for payment. The lady had\n",
      "a cloak about her face; but having desired a sup of water, while she\n",
      "drank it fell back, and she saw her very plain. Heathcliff held both\n",
      "bridles as they rode on, and they set their faces from the village, and\n",
      "went as fast as the rough roads would let them. The lass said nothing\n",
      "to her father, but she told it all over Gimmerton this morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I ran and peeped, for form’s sake, into Isabella’s room; confirming,\n",
      "when I returned, the servant’s statement. Mr. Linton had resumed his\n",
      "seat by the bed; on my re-entrance, he raised his eyes, read the\n",
      "meaning of my blank aspect, and dropped them without giving an order,\n",
      "or uttering a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back,” I\n",
      "inquired. “How should we do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She went of her own accord,” answered the master; “she had a right to\n",
      "go if she pleased. Trouble me no more about her. Hereafter she is only\n",
      "my sister in name: not because I disown her, but because she has\n",
      "disowned me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And that was all he said on the subject: he did not make a single inquiry\n",
      "further, or mention her in any way, except directing me to send what\n",

      "\n",
      "For two months the fugitives remained absent; in those two months, Mrs.\n",
      "Linton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was\n",
      "denominated a brain fever. No mother could have nursed an only child\n",
      "more devotedly than Edgar tended her. Day and night he was watching,\n",
      "and patiently enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a\n",
      "shaken reason could inflict; and, though Kenneth remarked that what he\n",
      "saved from the grave would only recompense his care by forming the\n",
      "source of constant future anxiety—in fact, that his health and strength\n",
      "were being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity—he knew no\n",
      "limits in gratitude and joy when Catherine’s life was declared out of\n",
      "danger; and hour after hour he would sit beside her, tracing the\n",
      "gradual return to bodily health, and flattering his too sanguine hopes\n",
      "with the illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance\n",
      "also, and she would soon be entirely her former self.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the\n",
      "following March. Mr. Linton had put on her pillow, in the morning, a\n",
      "handful of golden crocuses; her eye, long stranger to any gleam of\n",
      "pleasure, caught them in waking, and shone delighted as she gathered\n",
      "them eagerly together.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These are the earliest flowers at the Heights,” she exclaimed. “They\n",
      "remind me of soft thaw winds, and warm sunshine, and nearly melted\n",
      "snow. Edgar, is there not a south wind, and is not the snow almost\n",
      "gone?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The snow is quite gone down here, darling,” replied her husband; “and\n",
      "I only see two white spots on the whole range of moors: the sky is\n",
      "blue, and the larks are singing, and the becks and brooks are all brim\n",
      "full. Catherine, last spring at this time, I was longing to have you\n",
      "under this roof; now, I wish you were a mile or two up those hills: the\n",
      "air blows so sweetly, I feel that it would cure you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall never be there but once more,” said the invalid; “and then\n",
      "you’ll leave me, and I shall remain for ever. Next spring you’ll long\n",
      "again to have me under this roof, and you’ll look back and think you\n",
      "were happy to-day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Linton lavished on her the kindest caresses, and tried to cheer her by\n",
      "the fondest words; but, vaguely regarding the flowers, she let the\n",
      "tears collect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding. We\n",
      "knew she was really better, and, therefore, decided that long\n",
      "confinement to a single place produced much of this despondency, and it\n",
      "might be partially removed by a change of scene. The master told me to\n",
      "light a fire in the many-weeks’ deserted parlour, and to set an\n",
      "easy-chair in the sunshine by the window; and then he brought her down,\n",
      "and she sat a long while enjoying the genial heat, and, as we expected,\n",
      "revived by the objects round her: which, though familiar, were free\n",
      "from the dreary associations investing her hated sick chamber. By\n",
      "evening she seemed greatly exhausted; yet no arguments could persuade\n",
      "her to return to that apartment, and I had to arrange the parlour sofa\n",
      "for her bed, till another room could be prepared. To obviate the\n",
      "fatigue of mounting and descending the stairs, we fitted up this, where\n",
      "you lie at present—on the same floor with the parlour; and she was soon\n",
      "strong enough to move from one to the other, leaning on Edgar’s arm.\n",

      "there was double cause to desire it, for on her existence depended that\n",
      "of another: we cherished the hope that in a little while Mr. Linton’s\n",

      "gripe, by the birth of an heir.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should mention that Isabella sent to her brother, some six weeks from\n",
      "her departure, a short note, announcing her marriage with Heathcliff.\n",
      "It appeared dry and cold; but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil\n",
      "an obscure apology, and an entreaty for kind remembrance and\n",
      "reconciliation, if her proceeding had offended him: asserting that she\n",
      "could not help it then, and being done, she had now no power to repeal\n",
      "it. Linton did not reply to this, I believe; and, in a fortnight more,\n",
      "I got a long letter, which I considered odd, coming from the pen of a\n",
      "bride just out of the honeymoon. I’ll read it: for I keep it yet. Any\n",

      "DEAR ELLEN, it begins,—I came last night to Wuthering Heights, and\n",
      "heard, for the first time, that Catherine has been, and is yet, very\n",
      "ill. I must not write to her, I suppose, and my brother is either too\n",
      "angry or too distressed to answer what I sent him. Still, I must write\n",
      "to somebody, and the only choice left me is you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inform Edgar that I’d give the world to see his face again—that my\n",
      "heart returned to Thrushcross Grange in twenty-four hours after I left\n",
      "it, and is there at this moment, full of warm feelings for him, and\n",
      "Catherine! _I can’t follow it though_—(these words are underlined)—they\n",
      "need not expect me, and they may draw what conclusions they please;\n",
      "taking care, however, to lay nothing at the door of my weak will or\n",
      "deficient affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The remainder of the letter is for yourself alone. I want to ask you\n",
      "two questions: the first is,—How did you contrive to preserve the\n",
      "common sympathies of human nature when you resided here? I cannot\n",
      "recognise any sentiment which those around share with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second question I have great interest in; it is this—Is Mr.\n",
      "Heathcliff a man? If so, is he mad? And if not, is he a devil? I\n",
      "sha’n’t tell my reasons for making this inquiry; but I beseech you to\n",
      "explain, if you can, what I have married: that is, when you call to see\n",
      "me; and you must call, Ellen, very soon. Don’t write, but come, and\n",
      "bring me something from Edgar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, you shall hear how I have been received in my new home, as I am\n",
      "led to imagine the Heights will be. It is to amuse myself that I dwell\n",
      "on such subjects as the lack of external comforts: they never occupy my\n",
      "thoughts, except at the moment when I miss them. I should laugh and\n",
      "dance for joy, if I found their absence was the total of my miseries,\n",
      "and the rest was an unnatural dream!\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun set behind the Grange as we turned on to the moors; by that, I\n",
      "judged it to be six o’clock; and my companion halted half an hour, to\n",
      "inspect the park, and the gardens, and, probably, the place itself, as\n",
      "well as he could; so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard\n",
      "of the farmhouse, and your old fellow-servant, Joseph, issued out to\n",
      "receive us by the light of a dip candle. He did it with a courtesy that\n",
      "redounded to his credit. His first act was to elevate his torch to a\n",
      "level with my face, squint malignantly, project his under-lip, and turn\n",
      "away. Then he took the two horses, and led them into the stables;\n",
      "reappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate, as if we lived\n",
      "in an ancient castle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heathcliff stayed to speak to him, and I entered the kitchen—a dingy,\n",
      "untidy hole; I daresay you would not know it, it is so changed since it\n",
      "was in your charge. By the fire stood a ruffianly child, strong in limb\n",
      "and dirty in garb, with a look of Catherine in his eyes and about his\n",
      "mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is Edgar’s legal nephew,” I reflected—“mine in a manner; I must\n",
      "shake hands, and—yes—I must kiss him. It is right to establish a good\n",
      "understanding at the beginning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I approached, and, attempting to take his chubby fist, said—“How do you\n",
      "do, my dear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He replied in a jargon I did not comprehend.\n",
      "\n",

      "bull-dog from its lair in a corner. “Now, wilt thou be ganging?” he\n",
      "asked authoritatively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love for my life urged a compliance; I stepped over the threshold to\n",
      "wait till the others should enter. Mr. Heathcliff was nowhere visible;\n",
      "and Joseph, whom I followed to the stables, and requested to accompany\n",
      "me in, after staring and muttering to himself, screwed up his nose and\n",
      "replied—“Mim! mim! mim! Did iver Christian body hear aught like it?\n",
      "Mincing un’ munching! How can I tell whet ye say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say, I wish you to come with me into the house!” I cried, thinking\n",
      "him deaf, yet highly disgusted at his rudeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“None o’ me! I getten summut else to do,” he answered, and continued\n",
      "his work; moving his lantern jaws meanwhile, and surveying my dress and\n",
      "countenance (the former a great deal too fine, but the latter, I’m\n",
      "sure, as sad as he could desire) with sovereign contempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "I walked round the yard, and through a wicket, to another door, at\n",
      "which I took the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more civil servant\n",
      "might show himself. After a short suspense, it was opened by a tall,\n",
      "gaunt man, without neckerchief, and otherwise extremely slovenly; his\n",
      "features were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders;\n",
      "and _his_ eyes, too, were like a ghostly Catherine’s with all their\n",
      "beauty annihilated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s your business here?” he demanded, grimly. “Who are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My name _was_ Isabella Linton,” I replied. “You’ve seen me before,\n",
      "sir. I’m lately married to Mr. Heathcliff, and he has brought me here—I\n",
      "suppose by your permission.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he come back, then?” asked the hermit, glaring like a hungry wolf.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes—we came just now,” I said; “but he left me by the kitchen door;\n",
      "and when I would have gone in, your little boy played sentinel over the\n",
      "place, and frightened me off by the help of a bull-dog.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s well the hellish villain has kept his word!” growled my future\n",
      "host, searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering\n",
      "Heathcliff; and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations, and\n",
      "threats of what he would have done had the “fiend” deceived him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I repented having tried this second entrance, and was almost inclined\n",
      "to slip away before he finished cursing, but ere I could execute that\n",
      "intention, he ordered me in, and shut and re-fastened the door. There\n",
      "was a great fire, and that was all the light in the huge apartment,\n",
      "whose floor had grown a uniform grey; and the once brilliant\n",
      "pewter-dishes, which used to attract my gaze when I was a girl, partook\n",
      "of a similar obscurity, created by tarnish and dust. I inquired whether\n",
      "I might call the maid, and be conducted to a bedroom! Mr. Earnshaw\n",
      "vouchsafed no answer. He walked up and down, with his hands in his\n",
      "pockets, apparently quite forgetting my presence; and his abstraction\n",
      "was evidently so deep, and his whole aspect so misanthropical, that I\n",
      "shrank from disturbing him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "You’ll not be surprised, Ellen, at my feeling particularly cheerless,\n",
      "seated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth, and\n",
      "remembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home, containing\n",
      "the only people I loved on earth; and there might as well be the\n",
      "Atlantic to part us, instead of those four miles: I could not overpass\n",
      "them! I questioned with myself—where must I turn for comfort? and—mind\n",
      "you don’t tell Edgar, or Catherine—above every sorrow beside, this rose\n",
      "pre-eminent: despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally\n",
      "against Heathcliff! I had sought shelter at Wuthering Heights, almost\n",
      "gladly, because I was secured by that arrangement from living alone\n",
      "with him; but he knew the people we were coming amongst, and he did not\n",
      "fear their intermeddling.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat and thought a doleful time: the clock struck eight, and nine, and\n",
      "still my companion paced to and fro, his head bent on his breast, and\n",
      "perfectly silent, unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself\n",
      "out at intervals. I listened to detect a woman’s voice in the house,\n",
      "and filled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations,\n",
      "which, at last, spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping. I\n",
      "was not aware how openly I grieved, till Earnshaw halted opposite, in\n",
      "his measured walk, and gave me a stare of newly-awakened surprise.\n",
      "Taking advantage of his recovered attention, I exclaimed—“I’m tired\n",
      "with my journey, and I want to go to bed! Where is the maid-servant?\n",
      "Direct me to her, as she won’t come to me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have none,” he answered; “you must wait on yourself!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where must I sleep, then?” I sobbed; I was beyond regarding\n",
      "self-respect, weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Joseph will show you Heathcliff’s chamber,” said he; “open that\n",
      "door—he’s in there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was going to obey, but he suddenly arrested me, and added in the\n",
      "strangest tone—“Be so good as to turn your lock, and draw your\n",
      "bolt—don’t omit it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” I said. “But why, Mr. Earnshaw?” I did not relish the notion of\n",
      "deliberately fastening myself in with Heathcliff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look here!” he replied, pulling from his waistcoat a\n",
      "curiously-constructed pistol, having a double-edged spring knife\n",
      "attached to the barrel. “That’s a great tempter to a desperate man, is\n",
      "it not? I cannot resist going up with this every night, and trying his\n",
      "door. If once I find it open he’s done for; I do it invariably, even\n",
      "though the minute before I have been recalling a hundred reasons that\n",
      "should make me refrain: it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own\n",
      "schemes by killing him. You fight against that devil for love as long\n",
      "as you may; when the time comes, not all the angels in heaven shall\n",
      "save him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I surveyed the weapon inquisitively. A hideous notion struck me: how\n",
      "powerful I should be possessing such an instrument! I took it from his\n",
      "hand, and touched the blade. He looked astonished at the expression my\n",
      "face assumed during a brief second: it was not horror, it was\n",
      "covetousness. He snatched the pistol back, jealously; shut the knife,\n",
      "and returned it to its concealment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t care if you tell him,” said he. “Put him on his guard, and\n",
      "watch for him. You know the terms we are on, I see: his danger does not\n",
      "shock you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What has Heathcliff done to you?” I asked. “In what has he wronged\n",
      "you, to warrant this appalling hatred? Wouldn’t it be wiser to bid him\n",
      "quit the house?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No!” thundered Earnshaw; “should he offer to leave me, he’s a dead\n",
      "man: persuade him to attempt it, and you are a murderess! Am I to lose\n",
      "_all_, without a chance of retrieval? Is Hareton to be a beggar? Oh,\n",
      "damnation! I _will_ have it back; and I’ll have _his_ gold too; and\n",
      "then his blood; and hell shall have his soul! It will be ten times\n",
      "blacker with that guest than ever it was before!”\n",
      "\n",
      "You’ve acquainted me, Ellen, with your old master’s habits. He is\n",
      "clearly on the verge of madness: he was so last night at least. I\n",
      "shuddered to be near him, and thought on the servant’s ill-bred\n",
      "moroseness as comparatively agreeable. He now recommenced his moody\n",
      "walk, and I raised the latch, and escaped into the kitchen. Joseph was\n",
      "bending over the fire, peering into a large pan that swung above it;\n",
      "and a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by. The contents\n",
      "of the pan began to boil, and he turned to plunge his hand into the\n",
      "bowl; I conjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper,\n",
      "and, being hungry, I resolved it should be eatable; so, crying out\n",
      "sharply, “_I’ll_ make the porridge!” I removed the vessel out of his\n",
      "reach, and proceeded to take off my hat and riding-habit. “Mr.\n",
      "Earnshaw,” I continued, “directs me to wait on myself: I will. I’m not\n",
      "going to act the lady among you, for fear I should starve.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gooid Lord!” he muttered, sitting down, and stroking his ribbed\n",
      "stockings from the knee to the ankle. “If there’s to be fresh\n",
      "ortherings—just when I getten used to two maisters, if I mun hev’ a\n",
      "_mistress_ set o’er my heead, it’s like time to be flitting. I niver\n",
      "_did_ think to see t’ day that I mud lave th’ owld place—but I doubt\n",
      "it’s nigh at hand!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This lamentation drew no notice from me: I went briskly to work,\n",
      "sighing to remember a period when it would have been all merry fun; but\n",
      "compelled speedily to drive off the remembrance. It racked me to recall\n",
      "past happiness and the greater peril there was of conjuring up its\n",
      "apparition, the quicker the thible ran round, and the faster the\n",
      "handfuls of meal fell into the water. Joseph beheld my style of cookery\n",
      "with growing indignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thear!” he ejaculated. “Hareton, thou willn’t sup thy porridge\n",
      "to-neeght; they’ll be naught but lumps as big as my neive. Thear,\n",
      "agean! I’d fling in bowl un’ all, if I wer ye! There, pale t’ guilp\n",
      "off, un’ then ye’ll hae done wi’t. Bang, bang. It’s a mercy t’ bothom\n",
      "isn’t deaved out!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It _was_ rather a rough mess, I own, when poured into the basins; four\n",
      "had been provided, and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from\n",
      "the dairy, which Hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling\n",
      "from the expansive lip. I expostulated, and desired that he should have\n",
      "his in a mug; affirming that I could not taste the liquid treated so\n",
      "dirtily. The old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety;\n",
      "assuring me, repeatedly, that “the barn was every bit as good” as I,\n",
      "“and every bit as wollsome,” and wondering how I could fashion to be so\n",
      "conceited. Meanwhile, the infant ruffian continued sucking; and\n",
      "glowered up at me defyingly, as he slavered into the jug.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall have my supper in another room,” I said. “Have you no place\n",
      "you call a parlour?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Parlour_!” he echoed, sneeringly, “_parlour_! Nay, we’ve noa\n",
      "_parlours_. If yah dunnut loike wer company, there’s maister’s; un’ if\n",
      "yah dunnut loike maister, there’s us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I shall go upstairs,” I answered; “show me a chamber.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I put my basin on a tray, and went myself to fetch some more milk. With\n",
      "great grumblings, the fellow rose, and preceded me in my ascent: we\n",
      "mounted to the garrets; he opened a door, now and then, to look into\n",
      "the apartments we passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here’s a rahm,” he said, at last, flinging back a cranky board on\n",
      "hinges. “It’s weel eneugh to ate a few porridge in. There’s a pack o’\n",
      "corn i’ t’ corner, thear, meeterly clane; if ye’re feared o’ muckying\n",
      "yer grand silk cloes, spread yer hankerchir o’ t’ top on’t.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The “rahm” was a kind of lumber-hole smelling strong of malt and grain;\n",
      "various sacks of which articles were piled around, leaving a wide, bare\n",
      "space in the middle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, man,” I exclaimed, facing him angrily, “this is not a place to\n",
      "sleep in. I wish to see my bed-room.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Bed-rume_!” he repeated, in a tone of mockery. “Yah’s see all t’\n",
      "_bed-rumes_ thear is—yon’s mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He pointed into the second garret, only differing from the first in\n",
      "being more naked about the walls, and having a large, low, curtainless\n",
      "bed, with an indigo-coloured quilt, at one end.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do I want with yours?” I retorted. “I suppose Mr. Heathcliff does\n",
      "not lodge at the top of the house, does he?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! it’s Maister _Hathecliff’s_ ye’re wanting?” cried he, as if making\n",
      "a new discovery. “Couldn’t ye ha’ said soa, at onst? un’ then, I mud\n",
      "ha’ telled ye, baht all this wark, that that’s just one ye cannut\n",
      "see—he allas keeps it locked, un’ nob’dy iver mells on’t but hisseln.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ve a nice house, Joseph,” I could not refrain from observing, “and\n",
      "pleasant inmates; and I think the concentrated essence of all the\n",
      "madness in the world took up its abode in my brain the day I linked my\n",
      "fate with theirs! However, that is not to the present purpose—there are\n",
      "other rooms. For heaven’s sake be quick, and let me settle somewhere!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He made no reply to this adjuration; only plodding doggedly down the\n",
      "wooden steps, and halting before an apartment which, from that halt\n",
      "and the superior quality of its furniture, I conjectured to be the best\n",
      "one. There was a carpet—a good one, but the pattern was obliterated by\n",
      "dust; a fireplace hung with cut-paper, dropping to pieces; a handsome\n",
      "oak-bedstead with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material\n",
      "and modern make; but they had evidently experienced rough usage: the\n",
      "vallances hung in festoons, wrenched from their rings, and the iron rod\n",
      "supporting them was bent in an arc on one side, causing the drapery to\n",
      "trail upon the floor. The chairs were also damaged, many of them\n",
      "severely; and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls. I was\n",
      "endeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession,\n",
      "when my fool of a guide announced,—“This here is t’ maister’s.” My\n",
      "supper by this time was cold, my appetite gone, and my patience\n",
      "exhausted. I insisted on being provided instantly with a place of\n",
      "refuge, and means of repose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whear the divil?” began the religious elder. “The Lord bless us! The\n",
      "Lord forgie us! Whear the _hell_ wold ye gang? ye marred, wearisome\n",
      "nowt! Ye’ve seen all but Hareton’s bit of a cham’er. There’s not\n",
      "another hoile to lig down in i’ th’ hahse!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so vexed, I flung my tray and its contents on the ground; and\n",
      "then seated myself at the stairs’-head, hid my face in my hands, and\n",
      "cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ech! ech!” exclaimed Joseph. “Weel done, Miss Cathy! weel done, Miss\n",
      "Cathy! Howsiver, t’ maister sall just tum’le o’er them brocken pots;\n",

      "this silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my\n",
      "pride and choking my wrath, and bestirring myself to remove its\n",
      "effects. An unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of\n",
      "Throttler, whom I now recognised as a son of our old Skulker: it had\n",
      "spent its whelphood at the Grange, and was given by my father to Mr.\n",
      "Hindley. I fancy it knew me: it pushed its nose against mine by way of\n",
      "salute, and then hastened to devour the porridge; while I groped from\n",
      "step to step, collecting the shattered earthenware, and drying the\n",
      "spatters of milk from the banister with my pocket-handkerchief. Our\n",
      "labours were scarcely over when I heard Earnshaw’s tread in the\n",
      "passage; my assistant tucked in his tail, and pressed to the wall; I\n",
      "stole into the nearest doorway. The dog’s endeavour to avoid him was\n",
      "unsuccessful; as I guessed by a scutter downstairs, and a prolonged,\n",
      "piteous yelping. I had better luck: he passed on, entered his chamber,\n",
      "and shut the door. Directly after Joseph came up with Hareton, to put\n",
      "him to bed. I had found shelter in Hareton’s room, and the old man, on\n",
      "seeing me, said,—“They’s rahm for boath ye un’ yer pride, now, I sud\n",
      "think i’ the hahse. It’s empty; ye may hev’ it all to yerseln, un’ Him\n",

      "Gladly did I take advantage of this intimation; and the minute I flung\n",
      "myself into a chair, by the fire, I nodded, and slept. My slumber was\n",
      "deep and sweet, though over far too soon. Mr. Heathcliff awoke me; he\n",
      "had just come in, and demanded, in his loving manner, what I was doing\n",
      "there? I told him the cause of my staying up so late—that he had the\n",
      "key of our room in his pocket. The adjective _our_ gave mortal offence.\n",
      "He swore it was not, nor ever should be, mine; and he’d—but I’ll not\n",
      "repeat his language, nor describe his habitual conduct: he is ingenious\n",
      "and unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence! I sometimes wonder at\n",
      "him with an intensity that deadens my fear: yet, I assure you, a tiger\n",
      "or a venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which\n",
      "he wakens. He told me of Catherine’s illness, and accused my brother of\n",
      "causing it; promising that I should be Edgar’s proxy in suffering, till\n",
      "he could get hold of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do hate him—I am wretched—I have been a fool! Beware of uttering one\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as I had perused this epistle I went to the master, and\n",
      "informed him that his sister had arrived at the Heights, and sent me a\n",
      "letter expressing her sorrow for Mrs. Linton’s situation, and her\n",
      "ardent desire to see him; with a wish that he would transmit to her, as\n",
      "early as possible, some token of forgiveness by me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Forgiveness!” said Linton. “I have nothing to forgive her, Ellen. You\n",
      "may call at Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if you like, and say that\n",
      "I am not _angry_, but I’m _sorry_ to have lost her; especially as I can\n",
      "never think she’ll be happy. It is out of the question my going to see\n",
      "her, however: we are eternally divided; and should she really wish to\n",
      "oblige me, let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the\n",
      "country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you won’t write her a little note, sir?” I asked, imploringly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” he answered. “It is needless. My communication with Heathcliff’s\n",
      "family shall be as sparing as his with mine. It shall not exist!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Edgar’s coldness depressed me exceedingly; and all the way from the\n",
      "Grange I puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said,\n",
      "when I repeated it; and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines\n",
      "to console Isabella. I daresay she had been on the watch for me since\n",
      "morning: I saw her looking through the lattice as I came up the garden\n",
      "causeway, and I nodded to her; but she drew back, as if afraid of being\n",
      "observed. I entered without knocking. There never was such a dreary,\n",
      "dismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented! I must confess,\n",
      "that if I had been in the young lady’s place, I would, at least, have\n",
      "swept the hearth, and wiped the tables with a duster. But she already\n",
      "partook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her. Her\n",
      "pretty face was wan and listless; her hair uncurled: some locks hanging\n",
      "lankly down, and some carelessly twisted round her head. Probably she\n",
      "had not touched her dress since yester evening. Hindley was not there.\n",
      "Mr. Heathcliff sat at a table, turning over some papers in his\n",
      "pocket-book; but he rose when I appeared, asked me how I did, quite\n",
      "friendly, and offered me a chair. He was the only thing there that\n",
      "seemed decent; and I thought he never looked better. So much had\n",
      "circumstances altered their positions, that he would certainly have\n",
      "struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman; and his wife as a\n",
      "thorough little slattern! She came forward eagerly to greet me, and\n",
      "held out one hand to take the expected letter. I shook my head. She\n",
      "wouldn’t understand the hint, but followed me to a sideboard, where I\n",
      "went to lay my bonnet, and importuned me in a whisper to give her\n",
      "directly what I had brought. Heathcliff guessed the meaning of her\n",
      "manœuvres, and said—“If you have got anything for Isabella (as no\n",
      "doubt you have, Nelly), give it to her. You needn’t make a secret of\n",
      "it: we have no secrets between us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I have nothing,” I replied, thinking it best to speak the truth at\n",
      "once. “My master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either\n",
      "a letter or a visit from him at present. He sends his love, ma’am, and\n",
      "his wishes for your happiness, and his pardon for the grief you have\n",
      "occasioned; but he thinks that after this time his household and the\n",
      "household here should drop intercommunication, as nothing could come of\n",
      "keeping it up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Heathcliff’s lip quivered slightly, and she returned to her seat\n",
      "in the window. Her husband took his stand on the hearthstone, near me,\n",
      "and began to put questions concerning Catherine. I told him as much as\n",
      "I thought proper of her illness, and he extorted from me, by\n",
      "cross-examination, most of the facts connected with its origin. I\n",
      "blamed her, as she deserved, for bringing it all on herself; and ended\n",
      "by hoping that he would follow Mr. Linton’s example and avoid future\n",
      "interference with his family, for good or evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Linton is now just recovering,” I said; “she’ll never be like she\n",
      "was, but her life is spared; and if you really have a regard for her,\n",
      "you’ll shun crossing her way again: nay, you’ll move out of this\n",
      "country entirely; and that you may not regret it, I’ll inform you\n",
      "Catherine Linton is as different now from your old friend Catherine\n",
      "Earnshaw, as that young lady is different from me. Her appearance is\n",
      "changed greatly, her character much more so; and the person who is\n",
      "compelled, of necessity, to be her companion, will only sustain his\n",
      "affection hereafter by the remembrance of what she once was, by common\n",
      "humanity, and a sense of duty!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is quite possible,” remarked Heathcliff, forcing himself to seem\n",
      "calm: “quite possible that your master should have nothing but common\n",
      "humanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon. But do you imagine that\n",
      "I shall leave Catherine to his _duty_ and _humanity_? and can you\n",
      "compare my feelings respecting Catherine to his? Before you leave this\n",
      "house, I must exact a promise from you that you’ll get me an interview\n",
      "with her: consent, or refuse, I _will_ see her! What do you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say, Mr. Heathcliff,” I replied, “you must not: you never shall,\n",
      "through my means. Another encounter between you and the master would\n",
      "kill her altogether.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With your aid that may be avoided,” he continued; “and should there be\n",
      "danger of such an event—should he be the cause of adding a single\n",
      "trouble more to her existence—why, I think I shall be justified in\n",
      "going to extremes! I wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether\n",
      "Catherine would suffer greatly from his loss: the fear that she would\n",
      "restrains me. And there you see the distinction between our feelings:\n",
      "had he been in my place, and I in his, though I hated him with a hatred\n",
      "that turned my life to gall, I never would have raised a hand against\n",
      "him. You may look incredulous, if you please! I never would have\n",
      "banished him from her society as long as she desired his. The moment\n",
      "her regard ceased, I would have torn his heart out, and drunk his\n",
      "blood! But, till then—if you don’t believe me, you don’t know me—till\n",
      "then, I would have died by inches before I touched a single hair of his\n",
      "head!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yet,” I interrupted, “you have no scruples in completely ruining\n",
      "all hopes of her perfect restoration, by thrusting yourself into her\n",
      "remembrance now, when she has nearly forgotten you, and involving her\n",
      "in a new tumult of discord and distress.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You suppose she has nearly forgotten me?” he said. “Oh, Nelly! you\n",
      "know she has not! You know as well as I do, that for every thought she\n",
      "spends on Linton she spends a thousand on me! At a most miserable\n",
      "period of my life, I had a notion of the kind: it haunted me on my\n",
      "return to the neighbourhood last summer; but only her own assurance\n",
      "could make me admit the horrible idea again. And then, Linton would be\n",
      "nothing, nor Hindley, nor all the dreams that ever I dreamt. Two words\n",
      "would comprehend my future—_death_ and _hell_: existence, after losing\n",
      "her, would be hell. Yet I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she\n",
      "valued Edgar Linton’s attachment more than mine. If he loved with all\n",
      "the powers of his puny being, he couldn’t love as much in eighty years\n",
      "as I could in a day. And Catherine has a heart as deep as I have: the\n",
      "sea could be as readily contained in that horse-trough as her whole\n",
      "affection be monopolised by him. Tush! He is scarcely a degree dearer\n",
      "to her than her dog, or her horse. It is not in him to be loved like\n",
      "me: how can she love in him what he has not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Catherine and Edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can\n",
      "be,” cried Isabella, with sudden vivacity. “No one has a right to talk\n",
      "in that manner, and I won’t hear my brother depreciated in silence!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your brother is wondrous fond of you too, isn’t he?” observed\n",
      "Heathcliff, scornfully. “He turns you adrift on the world with\n",
      "surprising alacrity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is not aware of what I suffer,” she replied. “I didn’t tell him\n",
      "that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have been telling him something, then: you have written, have\n",
      "you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To say that I was married, I did write—you saw the note.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And nothing since?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change of condition,”\n",
      "I remarked. “Somebody’s love comes short in her case, obviously; whose,\n",
      "I may guess; but, perhaps, I shouldn’t say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should guess it was her own,” said Heathcliff. “She degenerates into\n",
      "a mere slut! She is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early.\n",
      "You’d hardly credit it, but the very morrow of our wedding she was\n",
      "weeping to go home. However, she’ll suit this house so much the better\n",
      "for not being over nice, and I’ll take care she does not disgrace me by\n",
      "rambling abroad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, sir,” returned I, “I hope you’ll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff\n",
      "is accustomed to be looked after and waited on; and that she has been\n",
      "brought up like an only daughter, whom every one was ready to serve.\n",
      "You must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her, and you\n",
      "must treat her kindly. Whatever be your notion of Mr. Edgar, you cannot\n",
      "doubt that she has a capacity for strong attachments, or she wouldn’t\n",
      "have abandoned the elegancies, and comforts, and friends of her former\n",
      "home, to fix contentedly, in such a wilderness as this, with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She abandoned them under a delusion,” he answered; “picturing in me a\n",
      "hero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous\n",
      "devotion. I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature,\n",
      "so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my\n",
      "character and acting on the false impressions she cherished. But, at\n",
      "last, I think she begins to know me: I don’t perceive the silly smiles\n",
      "and grimaces that provoked me at first; and the senseless incapability\n",
      "of discerning that I was in earnest when I gave her my opinion of her\n",
      "infatuation and herself. It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to\n",
      "discover that I did not love her. I believed, at one time, no lessons\n",
      "could teach her that! And yet it is poorly learnt; for this morning she\n",
      "announced, as a piece of appalling intelligence, that I had actually\n",
      "succeeded in making her hate me! A positive labour of Hercules, I\n",
      "assure you! If it be achieved, I have cause to return thanks. Can I\n",
      "trust your assertion, Isabella? Are you sure you hate me? If I let you\n",
      "alone for half a day, won’t you come sighing and wheedling to me again?\n",
      "I daresay she would rather I had seemed all tenderness before you: it\n",
      "wounds her vanity to have the truth exposed. But I don’t care who knows\n",
      "that the passion was wholly on one side: and I never told her a lie\n",
      "about it. She cannot accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful\n",
      "softness. The first thing she saw me do, on coming out of the Grange,\n",
      "was to hang up her little dog; and when she pleaded for it, the first\n",
      "words I uttered were a wish that I had the hanging of every being\n",
      "belonging to her, except one: possibly she took that exception for\n",
      "herself. But no brutality disgusted her: I suppose she has an innate\n",
      "admiration of it, if only her precious person were secure from injury!\n",
      "Now, was it not the depth of absurdity—of genuine idiocy, for that\n",
      "pitiful, slavish, mean-minded brach to dream that I could love her?\n",
      "Tell your master, Nelly, that I never, in all my life, met with such an\n",
      "abject thing as she is. She even disgraces the name of Linton; and I’ve\n",
      "sometimes relented, from pure lack of invention, in my experiments on\n",
      "what she could endure, and still creep shamefully cringing back! But\n",
      "tell him, also, to set his fraternal and magisterial heart at ease:\n",
      "that I keep strictly within the limits of the law. I have avoided, up\n",
      "to this period, giving her the slightest right to claim a separation;\n",
      "and, what’s more, she’d thank nobody for dividing us. If she desired to\n",
      "go, she might: the nuisance of her presence outweighs the gratification\n",
      "to be derived from tormenting her!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Heathcliff,” said I, “this is the talk of a madman; your wife,\n",
      "most likely, is convinced you are mad; and, for that reason, she has\n",
      "borne with you hitherto: but now that you say she may go, she’ll\n",
      "doubtless avail herself of the permission. You are not so bewitched,\n",
      "ma’am, are you, as to remain with him of your own accord?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take care, Ellen!” answered Isabella, her eyes sparkling irefully;\n",
      "there was no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her\n",
      "partner’s endeavours to make himself detested. “Don’t put faith in a\n",
      "single word he speaks. He’s a lying fiend! a monster, and not a human\n",
      "being! I’ve been told I might leave him before; and I’ve made the\n",
      "attempt, but I dare not repeat it! Only, Ellen, promise you’ll not\n",
      "mention a syllable of his infamous conversation to my brother or\n",
      "Catherine. Whatever he may pretend, he wishes to provoke Edgar to\n",
      "desperation: he says he has married me on purpose to obtain power over\n",
      "him; and he sha’n’t obtain it—I’ll die first! I just hope, I pray, that\n",
      "he may forget his diabolical prudence and kill me! The single pleasure\n",
      "I can imagine is to die, or to see him dead!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There—that will do for the present!” said Heathcliff. “If you are\n",
      "called upon in a court of law, you’ll remember her language, Nelly! And\n",
      "take a good look at that countenance: she’s near the point which would\n",
      "suit me. No; you’re not fit to be your own guardian, Isabella, now; and\n",
      "I, being your legal protector, must retain you in my custody, however\n",
      "distasteful the obligation may be. Go upstairs; I have something to say\n",
      "to Ellen Dean in private. That’s not the way: upstairs, I tell you!\n",
      "Why, this is the road upstairs, child!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He seized, and thrust her from the room; and returned muttering—“I have\n",
      "no pity! I have no pity! The more the worms writhe, the more I yearn to\n",
      "crush out their entrails! It is a moral teething; and I grind with\n",
      "greater energy in proportion to the increase of pain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you understand what the word pity means?” I said, hastening to\n",
      "resume my bonnet. “Did you ever feel a touch of it in your life?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Put that down!” he interrupted, perceiving my intention to depart.\n",
      "“You are not going yet. Come here now, Nelly: I must either persuade or\n",
      "compel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see Catherine,\n",
      "and that without delay. I swear that I meditate no harm: I don’t desire\n",
      "to cause any disturbance, or to exasperate or insult Mr. Linton; I only\n",
      "wish to hear from herself how she is, and why she has been ill; and to\n",
      "ask if anything that I could do would be of use to her. Last night I\n",
      "was in the Grange garden six hours, and I’ll return there to-night; and\n",
      "every night I’ll haunt the place, and every day, till I find an\n",
      "opportunity of entering. If Edgar Linton meets me, I shall not hesitate\n",
      "to knock him down, and give him enough to insure his quiescence while I\n",
      "stay. If his servants oppose me, I shall threaten them off with these\n",
      "pistols. But wouldn’t it be better to prevent my coming in contact with\n",
      "them, or their master? And you could do it so easily. I’d warn you when\n",
      "I came, and then you might let me in unobserved, as soon as she was\n",
      "alone, and watch till I departed, your conscience quite calm: you would\n",
      "be hindering mischief.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I protested against playing that treacherous part in my employer’s\n",
      "house: and, besides, I urged the cruelty and selfishness of his\n",
      "destroying Mrs. Linton’s tranquillity for his satisfaction. “The\n",
      "commonest occurrence startles her painfully,” I said. “She’s all\n",

      "prepare her—ask her if I may come. You say she never mentions my name,\n",
      "and that I am never mentioned to her. To whom should she mention me if\n",
      "I am a forbidden topic in the house? She thinks you are all spies for\n",
      "her husband. Oh, I’ve no doubt she’s in hell among you! I guess by her\n",

      "“What now?” said Catherine, leaning back, and returning his look with a\n",

      "you both come to bewail the deed to me, as if you were the people to be\n",
      "pitied! I shall not pity you, not I. You have killed me—and thriven on\n",

      "might Catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her,\n",
      "unless with her mortal body she cast away her moral character also. Her\n",
      "present countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek, and a\n",
      "bloodless lip and scintillating eye; and she retained in her closed\n",
      "fingers a portion of the locks she had been grasping. As to her\n",
      "companion, while raising himself with one hand, he had taken her arm\n",
      "with the other; and so inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the\n",

      "you have left me? You know you lie to say I have killed you: and,\n",
      "Catherine, you know that I could as soon forget you as my existence! Is\n",
      "it not sufficient for your infernal selfishness, that while you are at\n",
      "peace I shall writhe in the torments of hell?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall not be at peace,” moaned Catherine, recalled to a sense of\n",
      "physical weakness by the violent, unequal throbbing of her heart, which\n",
      "beat visibly and audibly under this excess of agitation. She said\n",
      "nothing further till the paroxysm was over; then she continued, more\n",
      "kindly—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m not wishing you greater torment than I have, Heathcliff. I only\n",
      "wish us never to be parted: and should a word of mine distress you\n",
      "hereafter, think I feel the same distress underground, and for my own\n",
      "sake, forgive me! Come here and kneel down again! You never harmed me\n",
      "in your life. Nay, if you nurse anger, that will be worse to remember\n",
      "than my harsh words! Won’t you come here again? Do!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Heathcliff went to the back of her chair, and leant over, but not so\n",
      "far as to let her see his face, which was livid with emotion. She bent\n",
      "round to look at him; he would not permit it: turning abruptly, he\n",
      "walked to the fireplace, where he stood, silent, with his back towards\n",
      "us. Mrs. Linton’s glance followed him suspiciously: every movement woke\n",
      "a new sentiment in her. After a pause and a prolonged gaze, she\n",
      "resumed; addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you see, Nelly, he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the\n",
      "grave. _That_ is how I’m loved! Well, never mind. That is not _my_\n",
      "Heathcliff. I shall love mine yet; and take him with me: he’s in my\n",
      "soul. And,” added she musingly, “the thing that irks me most is this\n",
      "shattered prison, after all. I’m tired of being enclosed here. I’m\n",
      "wearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there:\n",
      "not seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the\n",
      "walls of an aching heart: but really with it, and in it. Nelly, you\n",
      "think you are better and more fortunate than I; in full health and\n",
      "strength: you are sorry for me—very soon that will be altered. I shall\n",
      "be sorry for _you_. I shall be incomparably beyond and above you all. I\n",
      "_wonder_ he won’t be near me!” She went on to herself. “I thought he\n",
      "wished it. Heathcliff, dear! you should not be sullen now. Do come to\n",
      "me, Heathcliff.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of the\n",
      "chair. At that earnest appeal he turned to her, looking absolutely\n",
      "desperate. His eyes, wide and wet, at last flashed fiercely on her; his\n",
      "breast heaved convulsively. An instant they held asunder, and then how\n",
      "they met I hardly saw, but Catherine made a spring, and he caught her,\n",
      "and they were locked in an embrace from which I thought my mistress\n",
      "would never be released alive: in fact, to my eyes, she seemed directly\n",
      "insensible. He flung himself into the nearest seat, and on my\n",
      "approaching hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted, he gnashed at\n",
      "me, and foamed like a mad dog, and gathered her to him with greedy\n",
      "jealousy. I did not feel as if I were in the company of a creature of\n",
      "my own species: it appeared that he would not understand, though I\n",
      "spoke to him; so I stood off, and held my tongue, in great perplexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "A movement of Catherine’s relieved me a little presently: she put up\n",
      "her hand to clasp his neck, and bring her cheek to his as he held her;\n",
      "while he, in return, covering her with frantic caresses, said wildly—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You teach me now how cruel you’ve been—cruel and false. _Why_ did you\n",
      "despise me? _Why_ did you betray your own heart, Cathy? I have not one\n",
      "word of comfort. You deserve this. You have killed yourself. Yes, you\n",
      "may kiss me, and cry; and wring out my kisses and tears: they’ll blight\n",
      "you—they’ll damn you. You loved me—then what _right_ had you to leave\n",
      "me? What right—answer me—for the poor fancy you felt for Linton?\n",
      "Because misery and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or\n",
      "Satan could inflict would have parted us, _you_, of your own will, did\n",
      "it. I have not broken your heart—_you_ have broken it; and in breaking\n",
      "it, you have broken mine. So much the worse for me that I am strong. Do\n",
      "I want to live? What kind of living will it be when you—oh, God! would\n",
      "_you_ like to live with your soul in the grave?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let me alone. Let me alone,” sobbed Catherine. “If I’ve done wrong,\n",
      "I’m dying for it. It is enough! You left me too: but I won’t upbraid\n",
      "you! I forgive you. Forgive me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes, and feel those\n",
      "wasted hands,” he answered. “Kiss me again; and don’t let me see your\n",
      "eyes! I forgive what you have done to me. I love _my_ murderer—but\n",
      "_yours_! How can I?”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were silent—their faces hid against each other, and washed by each\n",
      "other’s tears. At least, I suppose the weeping was on both sides; as it\n",
      "seemed Heathcliff _could_ weep on a great occasion like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I grew very uncomfortable, meanwhile; for the afternoon wore fast away,\n",
      "the man whom I had sent off returned from his errand, and I could\n",
      "distinguish, by the shine of the western sun up the valley, a concourse\n",
      "thickening outside Gimmerton chapel porch.\n",

      "Ere long I perceived a group of the servants passing up the road\n",
      "towards the kitchen wing. Mr. Linton was not far behind; he opened the\n",

      "afternoon that breathed as soft as summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now he is here,” I exclaimed. “For heaven’s sake, hurry down! You’ll\n",

      "trees till he is fairly in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must go, Cathy,” said Heathcliff, seeking to extricate himself from\n",

      "asleep. I won’t stray five yards from your window.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must not go!” she answered, holding him as firmly as her strength\n",
      "allowed. “You _shall_ not, I tell you.”\n",

      "“For one hour,” he pleaded earnestly.\n",
      "\n",

      "“I _must_—Linton will be up immediately,” persisted the alarmed\n",
      "intruder.\n",
      "\n",
      "He would have risen, and unfixed her fingers by the act—she clung fast,\n",
      "gasping: there was mad resolution in her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No!” she shrieked. “Oh, don’t, don’t go. It is the last time! Edgar\n",
      "will not hurt us. Heathcliff, I shall die! I shall die!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Damn the fool! There he is,” cried Heathcliff, sinking back into his\n",
      "seat. “Hush, my darling! Hush, hush, Catherine! I’ll stay. If he shot\n",
      "me so, I’d expire with a blessing on my lips.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And there they were fast again. I heard my master mounting the\n",
      "stairs—the cold sweat ran from my forehead: I was horrified.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you going to listen to her ravings?” I said, passionately. “She\n",

      "to help herself? Get up! You could be free instantly. That is the most\n",
      "diabolical deed that ever you did. We are all done for—master,\n",
      "mistress, and servant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I wrung my hands, and cried out; and Mr. Linton hastened his step at\n",
      "the noise. In the midst of my agitation, I was sincerely glad to\n",

      "down.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s fainted, or dead,” I thought: “so much the better. Far better\n",

      "He walked into the parlour, and sat down. Mr. Linton summoned me, and\n",
      "with great difficulty, and after resorting to many means, we managed to\n",
      "restore her to sensation; but she was all bewildered; she sighed, and\n",
      "moaned, and knew nobody. Edgar, in his anxiety for her, forgot her\n",
      "hated friend. I did not. I went, at the earliest opportunity, and\n",

      "mother died, having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss\n",
      "Heathcliff, or know Edgar. The latter’s distraction at his bereavement\n",
      "is a subject too painful to be dwelt on; its after-effects showed how\n",
      "deep the sorrow sunk. A great addition, in my eyes, was his being left\n",
      "without an heir. I bemoaned that, as I gazed on the feeble orphan; and\n",
      "I mentally abused old Linton for (what was only natural partiality) the\n",
      "securing his estate to his own daughter, instead of his son’s. An\n",
      "unwelcomed infant it was, poor thing! It might have wailed out of life,\n",

      "with a mellow, tender glow. Edgar Linton had his head laid on the\n",
      "pillow, and his eyes shut. His young and fair features were almost as\n",
      "deathlike as those of the form beside him, and almost as fixed: but\n",
      "_his_ was the hush of exhausted anguish, and _hers_ of perfect peace.\n",
      "Her brow smooth, her lids closed, her lips wearing the expression of a\n",
      "smile; no angel in heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared.\n",
      "And I partook of the infinite calm in which she lay: my mind was never\n",
      "in a holier frame than while I gazed on that untroubled image of Divine\n",
      "rest. I instinctively echoed the words she had uttered a few hours\n",
      "before: “Incomparably beyond and above us all! Whether still on earth\n",

      "neither earth nor hell can break, and I feel an assurance of the\n",
      "endless and shadowless hereafter—the Eternity they have entered—where\n",
      "life is boundless in its duration, and love in its sympathy, and joy in\n",
      "its fulness. I noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is\n",
      "even in a love like Mr. Linton’s, when he so regretted Catherine’s\n",
      "blessed release! To be sure, one might have doubted, after the wayward\n",

      "peace at last. One might doubt in seasons of cold reflection; but not\n",

      "to find him. I felt the terrible news must be told, and I longed to get\n",
      "it over; but _how_ to do it I did not know. He was there—at least, a\n",
      "few yards further in the park; leant against an old ash-tree, his hat\n",
      "off, and his hair soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded\n",
      "branches, and fell pattering round him. He had been standing a long\n",
      "time in that position, for I saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing\n",
      "scarcely three feet from him, busy in building their nest, and\n",
      "regarding his proximity no more than that of a piece of timber. They\n",
      "flew off at my approach, and he raised his eyes and spoke:—“She’s\n",

      "He endeavoured to pronounce the name, but could not manage it; and\n",
      "compressing his mouth he held a silent combat with his inward agony,\n",

      "“How did she die?” he resumed, at last—fain, notwithstanding his\n",
      "hardihood, to have a support behind him; for, after the struggle, he\n",
      "trembled, in spite of himself, to his very finger-ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor wretch!” I thought; “you have a heart and nerves the same as your\n",

      "humiliation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quietly as a lamb!” I answered, aloud. “She drew a sigh, and stretched\n",

      "minutes after I felt one little pulse at her heart, and nothing more!”\n",

      "Catherine, it was impossible to avoid regarding this season of\n",
      "deliverance from degrading oppression as a holiday.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I recovered spirits sufficient to hear Joseph’s eternal lectures\n",
      "without weeping, and to move up and down the house less with the foot\n",
      "of a frightened thief than formerly. You wouldn’t think that I should\n",
      "cry at anything Joseph could say; but he and Hareton are detestable\n",
      "companions. I’d rather sit with Hindley, and hear his awful talk, than\n",
      "with ‘t’ little maister’ and his staunch supporter, that odious old\n",
      "man! When Heathcliff is in, I’m often obliged to seek the kitchen and\n",
      "their society, or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers; when he\n",
      "is not, as was the case this week, I establish a table and chair at one\n",
      "corner of the house fire, and never mind how Mr. Earnshaw may occupy\n",
      "himself; and he does not interfere with my arrangements. He is quieter\n",
      "now than he used to be, if no one provokes him: more sullen and\n",
      "depressed, and less furious. Joseph affirms he’s sure he’s an altered\n",
      "man: that the Lord has touched his heart, and he is saved ‘so as by\n",
      "fire.’ I’m puzzled to detect signs of the favourable change: but it is\n",
      "not my business.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yester-evening I sat in my nook reading some old books till late on\n",
      "towards twelve. It seemed so dismal to go upstairs, with the wild snow\n",
      "blowing outside, and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirkyard\n",
      "and the new-made grave! I dared hardly lift my eyes from the page\n",
      "before me, that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place.\n",
      "Hindley sat opposite, his head leant on his hand; perhaps meditating on\n",
      "the same subject. He had ceased drinking at a point below\n",
      "irrationality, and had neither stirred nor spoken during two or three\n",
      "hours. There was no sound through the house but the moaning wind, which\n",
      "shook the windows every now and then, the faint crackling of the coals,\n",
      "and the click of my snuffers as I removed at intervals the long wick of\n",
      "the candle. Hareton and Joseph were probably fast asleep in bed. It was\n",
      "very, very sad: and while I read I sighed, for it seemed as if all joy\n",
      "had vanished from the world, never to be restored.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The doleful silence was broken at length by the sound of the kitchen\n",
      "latch: Heathcliff had returned from his watch earlier than usual;\n",
      "owing, I suppose, to the sudden storm. That entrance was fastened, and\n",
      "we heard him coming round to get in by the other. I rose with an\n",
      "irrepressible expression of what I felt on my lips, which induced my\n",
      "companion, who had been staring towards the door, to turn and look at\n",
      "me.\n",

      "“Earnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the front; he then\n",
      "came and brought his chair to the other side of my table, leaning over\n",
      "it, and searching in my eyes for a sympathy with the burning hate that\n",
      "gleamed from his: as he both looked and felt like an assassin, he\n",
      "couldn’t exactly find that; but he discovered enough to encourage him\n",
      "to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘You, and I,’ he said, ‘have each a great debt to settle with the man\n",

      "\n",
      "“‘I’m weary of enduring now,’ I replied; ‘and I’d be glad of a\n",
      "retaliation that wouldn’t recoil on myself; but treachery and violence\n",

      "worse than their enemies.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Treachery and violence are a just return for treachery and violence!’\n",
      "cried Hindley. ‘Mrs. Heathcliff, I’ll ask you to do nothing; but sit\n",
      "still and be dumb. Tell me now, can you? I’m sure you would have as\n",
      "much pleasure as I in witnessing the conclusion of the fiend’s\n",
      "existence; he’ll be _your_ death unless you overreach him; and he’ll be\n",
      "_my_ ruin. Damn the hellish villain! He knocks at the door as if he\n",

      "however, and seized his arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘I’ll not hold my tongue!’ I said; ‘you mustn’t touch him. Let the\n",

      "\n",
      "“I might as well have struggled with a bear, or reasoned with a\n",
      "lunatic. The only resource left me was to run to a lattice and warn his\n",
      "intended victim of the fate which awaited him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘You’d better seek shelter somewhere else to-night!’ I exclaimed, in\n",
      "rather a triumphant tone. ‘Mr. Earnshaw has a mind to shoot you, if you\n",
      "persist in endeavouring to enter.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘You’d better open the door, you—’ he answered, addressing me by some\n",

      "having too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any\n",
      "anxiety for the danger that menaced him. Earnshaw swore passionately at\n",
      "me: affirming that I loved the villain yet; and calling me all sorts of\n",
      "names for the base spirit I evinced. And I, in my secret heart (and\n",
      "conscience never reproached me), thought what a blessing it would be\n",
      "for _him_ should Heathcliff put him out of misery; and what a blessing\n",
      "for _me_ should he send Heathcliff to his right abode! As I sat nursing\n",
      "these reflections, the casement behind me was banged on to the floor by\n",
      "a blow from the latter individual, and his black countenance looked\n",
      "blightingly through. The stanchions stood too close to suffer his\n",
      "shoulders to follow, and I smiled, exulting in my fancied security. His\n",
      "hair and clothes were whitened with snow, and his sharp cannibal teeth,\n",
      "revealed by cold and wrath, gleamed through the dark.\n",
      "\n",

      "our beds as long as the summer moon shone, but the moment a blast of\n",
      "winter returns, you must run for shelter! Heathcliff, if I were you,\n",
      "I’d go stretch myself over her grave and die like a faithful dog. The\n",
      "world is surely not worth living in now, is it? You had distinctly\n",

      "“I’m afraid, Ellen, you’ll set me down as really wicked; but you don’t\n",

      "on even _his_ life for anything. Wish that he were dead, I must; and\n",
      "therefore I was fearfully disappointed, and unnerved by terror for the\n",
      "consequences of my taunting speech, when he flung himself on Earnshaw’s\n",
      "weapon and wrenched it from his grasp.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The charge exploded, and the knife, in springing back, closed into its\n",
      "owner’s wrist. Heathcliff pulled it away by main force, slitting up the\n",
      "flesh as it passed on, and thrust it dripping into his pocket. He then\n",
      "took a stone, struck down the division between two windows, and sprang\n",
      "in. His adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain and the flow\n",
      "of blood, that gushed from an artery or a large vein. The ruffian\n",
      "kicked and trampled on him, and dashed his head repeatedly against the\n",
      "flags, holding me with one hand, meantime, to prevent me summoning\n",
      "Joseph. He exerted preterhuman self-denial in abstaining from finishing\n",
      "him completely; but getting out of breath, he finally desisted, and\n",
      "dragged the apparently inanimate body on to the settle. There he tore\n",
      "off the sleeve of Earnshaw’s coat, and bound up the wound with brutal\n",
      "roughness; spitting and cursing during the operation as energetically\n",
      "as he had kicked before. Being at liberty, I lost no time in seeking\n",
      "the old servant; who, having gathered by degrees the purport of my\n",

      "once.\n",

      "“‘What is ther to do, now? what is ther to do, now?’\n",
      "\n",

      "the devil did you come to fasten me out, you toothless hound? Don’t\n",
      "stand muttering and mumbling there. Come, I’m not going to nurse him.\n",
      "Wash that stuff away; and mind the sparks of your candle—it is more\n",

      "Lord—’\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the middle of the blood,\n",
      "and flung a towel to him; but instead of proceeding to dry it up, he\n",
      "joined his hands and began a prayer, which excited my laughter from its\n",
      "odd phraseology. I was in the condition of mind to be shocked at\n",
      "nothing: in fact, I was as reckless as some malefactors show themselves\n",
      "at the foot of the gallows.\n",
      "\n",

      "steadily concluded his supplications, and then rose, vowing he would\n",
      "set off for the Grange directly. Mr. Linton was a magistrate, and\n",
      "though he had fifty wives dead, he should inquire into this. He was so\n",
      "obstinate in his resolution, that Heathcliff deemed it expedient to\n",
      "compel from my lips a recapitulation of what had taken place; standing\n",
      "over me, heaving with malevolence, as I reluctantly delivered the\n",
      "account in answer to his questions. It required a great deal of labour\n",
      "to satisfy the old man that Heathcliff was not the aggressor;\n",
      "especially with my hardly-wrung replies. However, Mr. Earnshaw soon\n",
      "convinced him that he was alive still; Joseph hastened to administer a\n",
      "dose of spirits, and by their succour his master presently regained\n",
      "motion and consciousness. Heathcliff, aware that his opponent was\n",
      "ignorant of the treatment received while insensible, called him\n",
      "deliriously intoxicated; and said he should not notice his atrocious\n",
      "conduct further, but advised him to get to bed. To my joy, he left us,\n",
      "after giving this judicious counsel, and Hindley stretched himself on\n",
      "the hearthstone. I departed to my own room, marvelling that I had\n",
      "escaped so easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This morning, when I came down, about half an hour before noon, Mr.\n",
      "Earnshaw was sitting by the fire, deadly sick; his evil genius, almost\n",
      "as gaunt and ghastly, leant against the chimney. Neither appeared\n",
      "inclined to dine, and, having waited till all was cold on the table, I\n",
      "commenced alone. Nothing hindered me from eating heartily, and I\n",
      "experienced a certain sense of satisfaction and superiority, as, at\n",
      "intervals, I cast a look towards my silent companions, and felt the\n",
      "comfort of a quiet conscience within me. After I had done, I ventured\n",
      "on the unusual liberty of drawing near the fire, going round Earnshaw’s\n",
      "seat, and kneeling in the corner beside him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heathcliff did not glance my way, and I gazed up, and contemplated his\n",
      "features almost as confidently as if they had been turned to stone. His\n",
      "forehead, that I once thought so manly, and that I now think so\n",
      "diabolical, was shaded with a heavy cloud; his basilisk eyes were\n",
      "nearly quenched by sleeplessness, and weeping, perhaps, for the lashes\n",
      "were wet then: his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer, and sealed in\n",
      "an expression of unspeakable sadness. Had it been another, I would have\n",
      "covered my face in the presence of such grief. In _his_ case, I was\n",
      "gratified; and, ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy, I\n",
      "couldn’t miss this chance of sticking in a dart: his weakness was the\n",
      "only time when I could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fie, fie, Miss!” I interrupted. “One might suppose you had never\n",
      "opened a Bible in your life. If God afflict your enemies, surely that\n",
      "ought to suffice you. It is both mean and presumptuous to add your\n",
      "torture to his!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In general I’ll allow that it would be, Ellen,” she continued; “but\n",
      "what misery laid on Heathcliff could content me, unless I have a hand\n",
      "in it? I’d rather he suffered _less_, if I might cause his sufferings\n",
      "and he might _know_ that I was the cause. Oh, I owe him so much. On\n",
      "only one condition can I hope to forgive him. It is, if I may take an\n",
      "eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; for every wrench of agony return a\n",
      "wrench: reduce him to my level. As he was the first to injure, make him\n",
      "the first to implore pardon; and then—why then, Ellen, I might show you\n",
      "some generosity. But it is utterly impossible I can ever be revenged,\n",
      "and therefore I cannot forgive him. Hindley wanted some water, and I\n",
      "handed him a glass, and asked him how he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Not as ill as I wish,’ he replied. ‘But leaving out my arm, every\n",
      "inch of me is as sore as if I had been fighting with a legion of imps!’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Yes, no wonder,’ was my next remark. ‘Catherine used to boast that\n",
      "she stood between you and bodily harm: she meant that certain persons\n",
      "would not hurt you for fear of offending her. It’s well people don’t\n",
      "_really_ rise from their grave, or, last night, she might have\n",
      "witnessed a repulsive scene! Are not you bruised, and cut over your\n",
      "chest and shoulders?’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘I can’t say,’ he answered; ‘but what do you mean? Did he dare to\n",
      "strike me when I was down?’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘He trampled on and kicked you, and dashed you on the ground,’ I\n",
      "whispered. ‘And his mouth watered to tear you with his teeth; because\n",
      "he’s only half man: not so much, and the rest fiend.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Earnshaw looked up, like me, to the countenance of our mutual foe;\n",
      "who, absorbed in his anguish, seemed insensible to anything around him:\n",
      "the longer he stood, the plainer his reflections revealed their\n",
      "blackness through his features.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Oh, if God would but give me strength to strangle him in my last\n",
      "agony, I’d go to hell with joy,’ groaned the impatient man, writhing to\n",

      "struggle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Nay, it’s enough that he has murdered one of you,’ I observed aloud.\n",
      "‘At the Grange, every one knows your sister would have been living now\n",

      "hated than loved by him. When I recollect how happy we were—how happy\n",
      "Catherine was before he came—I’m fit to curse the day.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“Most likely, Heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said, than\n",
      "the spirit of the person who said it. His attention was roused, I saw,\n",
      "for his eyes rained down tears among the ashes, and he drew his breath\n",
      "in suffocating sighs. I stared full at him, and laughed scornfully. The\n",
      "clouded windows of hell flashed a moment towards me; the fiend which\n",
      "usually looked out, however, was so dimmed and drowned that I did not\n",
      "fear to hazard another sound of derision.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Get up, and begone out of my sight,’ said the mourner.\n",

      "hardly intelligible.\n",

      "brother requires attendance, which, for her sake, I shall supply. Now\n",
      "that she’s dead, I see her in Hindley: Hindley has exactly her eyes, if\n",
      "you had not tried to gouge them out, and made them black and red; and\n",
      "her—’\n",
      "\n",

      "Catherine had trusted you, and assumed the ridiculous, contemptible,\n",
      "degrading title of Mrs. Heathcliff, she would soon have presented a\n",
      "similar picture! _She_ wouldn’t have borne your abominable behaviour\n",
      "quietly: her detestation and disgust must have found voice.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“The back of the settle and Earnshaw’s person interposed between me and\n",
      "him; so instead of endeavouring to reach me, he snatched a dinner-knife\n",
      "from the table and flung it at my head. It struck beneath my ear, and\n",
      "stopped the sentence I was uttering; but, pulling it out, I sprang to\n",
      "the door and delivered another; which I hope went a little deeper than\n",
      "his missile. The last glimpse I caught of him was a furious rush on his\n",
      "part, checked by the embrace of his host; and both fell locked together\n",
      "on the hearth. In my flight through the kitchen I bid Joseph speed to\n",
      "his master; I knocked over Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies\n",
      "from a chair-back in the doorway; and, blessed as a soul escaped from\n",
      "purgatory, I bounded, leaped, and flew down the steep road; then,\n",
      "quitting its windings, shot direct across the moor, rolling over banks,\n",
      "and wading through marshes: precipitating myself, in fact, towards the\n",
      "beacon-light of the Grange. And far rather would I be condemned to a\n",
      "perpetual dwelling in the infernal regions than, even for one night,\n",
      "abide beneath the roof of Wuthering Heights again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Isabella ceased speaking, and took a drink of tea; then she rose, and\n",

      "turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour, she\n",
      "stepped on to a chair, kissed Edgar’s and Catherine’s portraits,\n",
      "bestowed a similar salute on me, and descended to the carriage,\n",
      "accompanied by Fanny, who yelped wild with joy at recovering her\n",
      "mistress. She was driven away, never to revisit this neighbourhood: but\n",
      "a regular correspondence was established between her and my master when\n",
      "things were more settled. I believe her new abode was in the south,\n",
      "near London; there she had a son born a few months subsequent to her\n",

      "him, if he had to keep her himself. Though I would give no information,\n",
      "he discovered, through some of the other servants, both her place of\n",
      "residence and the existence of the child. Still, he didn’t molest her:\n",
      "for which forbearance she might thank his aversion, I suppose. He often\n",
      "asked about the infant, when he saw me; and on hearing its name, smiled\n",
      "grimly, and observed: “They wish me to hate it too, do they?”\n",

      "“I don’t think they wish you to know anything about it,” I answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I’ll have it,” he said, “when I want it. They may reckon on that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately its mother died before the time arrived; some thirteen\n",
      "years after the decease of Catherine, when Linton was twelve, or a\n",
      "little more.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the day succeeding Isabella’s unexpected visit I had no opportunity\n",
      "of speaking to my master: he shunned conversation, and was fit for\n",
      "discussing nothing. When I could get him to listen, I saw it pleased\n",
      "him that his sister had left her husband; whom he abhorred with an\n",
      "intensity which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to\n",
      "allow. So deep and sensitive was his aversion, that he refrained from\n",
      "going anywhere where he was likely to see or hear of Heathcliff. Grief,\n",
      "and that together, transformed him into a complete hermit: he threw up\n",
      "his office of magistrate, ceased even to attend church, avoided the\n",
      "village on all occasions, and spent a life of entire seclusion within\n",
      "the limits of his park and grounds; only varied by solitary rambles on\n",
      "the moors, and visits to the grave of his wife, mostly at evening, or\n",
      "early morning before other wanderers were abroad. But he was too good\n",
      "to be thoroughly unhappy long. _He_ didn’t pray for Catherine’s soul to\n",
      "haunt him. Time brought resignation, and a melancholy sweeter than\n",
      "common joy. He recalled her memory with ardent, tender love, and\n",
      "hopeful aspiring to the better world; where he doubted not she was\n",
      "gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he had earthly consolation and affections also. For a few days, I\n",
      "said, he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed: that\n",
      "coldness melted as fast as snow in April, and ere the tiny thing could\n",
      "stammer a word or totter a step it wielded a despot’s sceptre in his\n",
      "heart. It was named Catherine; but he never called it the name in full,\n",
      "as he had never called the first Catherine short: probably because\n",
      "Heathcliff had a habit of doing so. The little one was always Cathy: it\n",
      "formed to him a distinction from the mother, and yet a connection with\n",
      "her; and his attachment sprang from its relation to her, far more than\n",
      "from its being his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used to draw a comparison between him and Hindley Earnshaw, and\n",
      "perplex myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so\n",
      "opposite in similar circumstances. They had both been fond husbands,\n",
      "and were both attached to their children; and I could not see how they\n",
      "shouldn’t both have taken the same road, for good or evil. But, I\n",
      "thought in my mind, Hindley, with apparently the stronger head, has\n",
      "shown himself sadly the worse and the weaker man. When his ship struck,\n",
      "the captain abandoned his post; and the crew, instead of trying to save\n",
      "her, rushed into riot and confusion, leaving no hope for their luckless\n",
      "vessel. Linton, on the contrary, displayed the true courage of a loyal\n",
      "and faithful soul: he trusted God; and God comforted him. One hoped,\n",
      "and the other despaired: they chose their own lots, and were\n",
      "righteously doomed to endure them. But you’ll not want to hear my\n",
      "moralising, Mr. Lockwood; you’ll judge, as well as I can, all these\n",
      "things: at least, you’ll think you will, and that’s the same. The end\n",
      "of Earnshaw was what might have been expected; it followed fast on his\n",
      "sister’s: there were scarcely six months between them. We, at the\n",
      "Grange, never got a very succinct account of his state preceding it;\n",
      "all that I did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the\n",
      "preparations for the funeral. Mr. Kenneth came to announce the event to\n",
      "my master.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Nelly,” said he, riding into the yard one morning, too early not\n",
      "to alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news, “it’s yours and\n",
      "my turn to go into mourning at present. Who’s given us the slip now, do\n",
      "you think?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who?” I asked in a flurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, guess!” he returned, dismounting, and slinging his bridle on a\n",
      "hook by the door. “And nip up the corner of your apron: I’m certain\n",
      "you’ll need it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not Mr. Heathcliff, surely?” I exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What! would you have tears for him?” said the doctor. “No,\n",
      "Heathcliff’s a tough young fellow: he looks blooming to-day. I’ve just\n",
      "seen him. He’s rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better half.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is it, then, Mr. Kenneth?” I repeated impatiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hindley Earnshaw! Your old friend Hindley,” he replied, “and my wicked\n",
      "gossip: though he’s been too wild for me this long while. There! I said\n",
      "we should draw water. But cheer up! He died true to his character:\n",
      "drunk as a lord. Poor lad! I’m sorry, too. One can’t help missing an\n",
      "old companion: though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man\n",
      "imagined, and has done me many a rascally turn. He’s barely\n",
      "twenty-seven, it seems; that’s your own age: who would have thought you\n",
      "were born in one year?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of Mrs. Linton’s\n",
      "death: ancient associations lingered round my heart; I sat down in the\n",
      "porch and wept as for a blood relation, desiring Mr. Kenneth to get\n",
      "another servant to introduce him to the master. I could not hinder\n",
      "myself from pondering on the question—“Had he had fair play?” Whatever\n",
      "I did, that idea would bother me: it was so tiresomely pertinacious\n",
      "that I resolved on requesting leave to go to Wuthering Heights, and\n",
      "assist in the last duties to the dead. Mr. Linton was extremely\n",
      "reluctant to consent, but I pleaded eloquently for the friendless\n",
      "condition in which he lay; and I said my old master and foster-brother\n",
      "had a claim on my services as strong as his own. Besides, I reminded\n",
      "him that the child Hareton was his wife’s nephew, and, in the absence\n",
      "of nearer kin, he ought to act as its guardian; and he ought to and\n",
      "must inquire how the property was left, and look over the concerns of\n",
      "his brother-in-law. He was unfit for attending to such matters then,\n",
      "but he bid me speak to his lawyer; and at length permitted me to go.\n",
      "His lawyer had been Earnshaw’s also: I called at the village, and asked\n",
      "him to accompany me. He shook his head, and advised that Heathcliff\n",
      "should be let alone; affirming, if the truth were known, Hareton would\n",
      "be found little else than a beggar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“His father died in debt,” he said; “the whole property is mortgaged,\n",
      "and the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity\n",
      "of creating some interest in the creditor’s heart, that he may be\n",
      "inclined to deal leniently towards him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When I reached the Heights, I explained that I had come to see\n",
      "everything carried on decently; and Joseph, who appeared in sufficient\n",
      "distress, expressed satisfaction at my presence. Mr. Heathcliff said he\n",
      "did not perceive that I was wanted; but I might stay and order the\n",
      "arrangements for the funeral, if I chose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Correctly,” he remarked, “that fool’s body should be buried at the\n",
      "cross-roads, without ceremony of any kind. I happened to leave him ten\n",
      "minutes yesterday afternoon, and in that interval he fastened the two\n",
      "doors of the house against me, and he has spent the night in drinking\n",
      "himself to death deliberately! We broke in this morning, for we heard\n",
      "him snorting like a horse; and there he was, laid over the settle:\n",
      "flaying and scalping would not have wakened him. I sent for Kenneth,\n",
      "and he came; but not till the beast had changed into carrion: he was\n",
      "both dead and cold, and stark; and so you’ll allow it was useless\n",
      "making more stir about him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The old servant confirmed this statement, but muttered:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d rayther he’d goan hisseln for t’ doctor! I sud ha’ taen tent o’ t’\n",
      "maister better nor him—and he warn’t deead when I left, naught o’ t’\n",
      "soart!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I insisted on the funeral being respectable. Mr. Heathcliff said I\n",
      "might have my own way there too: only, he desired me to remember that\n",
      "the money for the whole affair came out of his pocket. He maintained a\n",
      "hard, careless deportment, indicative of neither joy nor sorrow: if\n",
      "anything, it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult\n",
      "work successfully executed. I observed once, indeed, something like\n",
      "exultation in his aspect: it was just when the people were bearing the\n",
      "coffin from the house. He had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner: and\n",
      "previous to following with Hareton, he lifted the unfortunate child on\n",
      "to the table and muttered, with peculiar gusto, “Now, my bonny lad, you\n",
      "are _mine_! And we’ll see if one tree won’t grow as crooked as another,\n",
      "with the same wind to twist it!” The unsuspecting thing was pleased at\n",
      "this speech: he played with Heathcliff’s whiskers, and stroked his\n",
      "cheek; but I divined its meaning, and observed tartly, “That boy must\n",
      "go back with me to Thrushcross Grange, sir. There is nothing in the\n",
      "world less yours than he is!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does Linton say so?” he demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course—he has ordered me to take him,” I replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said the scoundrel, “we’ll not argue the subject now: but I\n",
      "have a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one; so intimate to your\n",
      "master that I must supply the place of this with my own, if he attempt\n",
      "to remove it. I don’t engage to let Hareton go undisputed; but I’ll be\n",
      "pretty sure to make the other come! Remember to tell him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This hint was enough to bind our hands. I repeated its substance on my\n",
      "return; and Edgar Linton, little interested at the commencement, spoke\n",
      "no more of interfering. I’m not aware that he could have done it to any\n",
      "purpose, had he been ever so willing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guest was now the master of Wuthering Heights: he held firm\n",
      "possession, and proved to the attorney—who, in his turn, proved it to\n",
      "Mr. Linton—that Earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for\n",
      "cash to supply his mania for gaming; and he, Heathcliff, was the\n",
      "mortgagee. In that manner Hareton, who should now be the first\n",
      "gentleman in the neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of complete\n",
      "dependence on his father’s inveterate enemy; and lives in his own house\n",
      "as a servant, deprived of the advantage of wages: quite unable to right\n",
      "himself, because of his friendlessness, and his ignorance that he has\n",
      "been wronged.\n",

      "CHAPTER XVIII\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The twelve years, continued Mrs. Dean, following that dismal period\n",
      "were the happiest of my life: my greatest troubles in their passage\n",
      "rose from our little lady’s trifling illnesses, which she had to\n",
      "experience in common with all children, rich and poor. For the rest,\n",
      "after the first six months, she grew like a larch, and could walk and\n",
      "talk too, in her own way, before the heath blossomed a second time over\n",
      "Mrs. Linton’s dust. She was the most winning thing that ever brought\n",
      "sunshine into a desolate house: a real beauty in face, with the\n",
      "Earnshaws’ handsome dark eyes, but the Lintons’ fair skin and small\n",
      "features, and yellow curling hair. Her spirit was high, though not\n",
      "rough, and qualified by a heart sensitive and lively to excess in its\n",
      "affections. That capacity for intense attachments reminded me of her\n",
      "mother: still she did not resemble her: for she could be soft and mild\n",
      "as a dove, and she had a gentle voice and pensive expression: her anger\n",
      "was never furious; her love never fierce: it was deep and tender.\n",
      "However, it must be acknowledged, she had faults to foil her gifts. A\n",
      "propensity to be saucy was one; and a perverse will, that indulged\n",
      "children invariably acquire, whether they be good tempered or cross. If\n",
      "a servant chanced to vex her, it was always—“I shall tell papa!” And if\n",
      "he reproved her, even by a look, you would have thought it a\n",
      "heart-breaking business: I don’t believe he ever did speak a harsh word\n",
      "to her. He took her education entirely on himself, and made it an\n",
      "amusement. Fortunately, curiosity and a quick intellect made her an apt\n",
      "scholar: she learned rapidly and eagerly, and did honour to his\n",
      "teaching.\n",
      "\n",
      "Till she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been beyond the\n",
      "range of the park by herself. Mr. Linton would take her with him a mile\n",
      "or so outside, on rare occasions; but he trusted her to no one else.\n",
      "Gimmerton was an unsubstantial name in her ears; the chapel, the only\n",
      "building she had approached or entered, except her own home. Wuthering\n",
      "Heights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for her: she was a perfect\n",
      "recluse; and, apparently, perfectly contented. Sometimes, indeed, while\n",
      "surveying the country from her nursery window, she would observe—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ellen, how long will it be before I can walk to the top of those\n",
      "hills? I wonder what lies on the other side—is it the sea?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Miss Cathy,” I would answer; “it is hills again, just like these.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them?” she\n",
      "once asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The abrupt descent of Penistone Crags particularly attracted her\n",
      "notice; especially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost\n",
      "heights, and the whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow. I\n",
      "explained that they were bare masses of stone, with hardly enough earth\n",
      "in their clefts to nourish a stunted tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And why are they bright so long after it is evening here?” she\n",
      "pursued.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because they are a great deal higher up than we are,” replied I; “you\n",
      "could not climb them, they are too high and steep. In winter the frost\n",
      "is always there before it comes to us; and deep into summer I have\n",
      "found snow under that black hollow on the north-east side!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you have been on them!” she cried gleefully. “Then I can go, too,\n",
      "when I am a woman. Has papa been, Ellen?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Papa would tell you, Miss,” I answered, hastily, “that they are not\n",
      "worth the trouble of visiting. The moors, where you ramble with him,\n",
      "are much nicer; and Thrushcross Park is the finest place in the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I know the park, and I don’t know those,” she murmured to herself.\n",
      "“And I should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest\n",
      "point: my little pony Minny shall take me some time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the maids mentioning the Fairy Cave, quite turned her head with\n",
      "a desire to fulfil this project: she teased Mr. Linton about it; and he\n",
      "promised she should have the journey when she got older. But Miss\n",
      "Catherine measured her age by months, and, “Now, am I old enough to go\n",
      "to Penistone Crags?” was the constant question in her mouth. The road\n",
      "thither wound close by Wuthering Heights. Edgar had not the heart to\n",
      "pass it; so she received as constantly the answer, “Not yet, love: not\n",
      "yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I said Mrs. Heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her\n",
      "husband. Her family were of a delicate constitution: she and Edgar both\n",
      "lacked the ruddy health that you will generally meet in these parts.\n",
      "What her last illness was, I am not certain: I conjecture, they died of\n",
      "the same thing, a kind of fever, slow at its commencement, but\n",
      "incurable, and rapidly consuming life towards the close. She wrote to\n",
      "inform her brother of the probable conclusion of a four-months’\n",
      "indisposition under which she had suffered, and entreated him to come\n",
      "to her, if possible; for she had much to settle, and she wished to bid\n",
      "him adieu, and deliver Linton safely into his hands. Her hope was that\n",
      "Linton might be left with him, as he had been with her: his father, she\n",
      "would fain convince herself, had no desire to assume the burden of his\n",
      "maintenance or education. My master hesitated not a moment in complying\n",
      "with her request: reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls,\n",
      "he flew to answer this; commending Catherine to my peculiar vigilance,\n",
      "in his absence, with reiterated orders that she must not wander out of\n",
      "the park, even under my escort: he did not calculate on her going\n",
      "unaccompanied.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was away three weeks. The first day or two my charge sat in a corner\n",
      "of the library, too sad for either reading or playing: in that quiet\n",
      "state she caused me little trouble; but it was succeeded by an interval\n",
      "of impatient, fretful weariness; and being too busy, and too old then,\n",
      "to run up and down amusing her, I hit on a method by which she might\n",
      "entertain herself. I used to send her on her travels round the\n",
      "grounds—now on foot, and now on a pony; indulging her with a patient\n",
      "audience of all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The summer shone in full prime; and she took such a taste for this\n",
      "solitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out from breakfast\n",
      "till tea; and then the evenings were spent in recounting her fanciful\n",
      "tales. I did not fear her breaking bounds; because the gates were\n",
      "generally locked, and I thought she would scarcely venture forth alone,\n",
      "if they had stood wide open. Unluckily, my confidence proved misplaced.\n",
      "Catherine came to me, one morning, at eight o’clock, and said she was\n",
      "that day an Arabian merchant, going to cross the Desert with his\n",
      "caravan; and I must give her plenty of provision for herself and\n",
      "beasts: a horse, and three camels, personated by a large hound and a\n",
      "couple of pointers. I got together good store of dainties, and slung\n",
      "them in a basket on one side of the saddle; and she sprang up as gay as\n",
      "a fairy, sheltered by her wide-brimmed hat and gauze veil from the July\n",
      "sun, and trotted off with a merry laugh, mocking my cautious counsel to\n",
      "avoid galloping, and come back early. The naughty thing never made her\n",
      "appearance at tea. One traveller, the hound, being an old dog and fond\n",
      "of its ease, returned; but neither Cathy, nor the pony, nor the two\n",
      "pointers were visible in any direction: I despatched emissaries down\n",
      "this path, and that path, and at last went wandering in search of her\n",
      "myself. There was a labourer working at a fence round a plantation, on\n",
      "the borders of the grounds. I inquired of him if he had seen our young\n",
      "lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw her at morn,” he replied: “she would have me to cut her a hazel\n",
      "switch, and then she leapt her Galloway over the hedge yonder, where it\n",
      "is lowest, and galloped out of sight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "You may guess how I felt at hearing this news. It struck me directly\n",
      "she must have started for Penistone Crags. “What will become of her?” I\n",
      "ejaculated, pushing through a gap which the man was repairing, and\n",
      "making straight to the high-road. I walked as if for a wager, mile\n",
      "after mile, till a turn brought me in view of the Heights; but no\n",
      "Catherine could I detect, far or near. The Crags lie about a mile and a\n",
      "half beyond Mr. Heathcliff’s place, and that is four from the Grange,\n",
      "so I began to fear night would fall ere I could reach them. “And what\n",
      "if she should have slipped in clambering among them,” I reflected, “and\n",
      "been killed, or broken some of her bones?” My suspense was truly\n",
      "painful; and, at first, it gave me delightful relief to observe, in\n",
      "hurrying by the farmhouse, Charlie, the fiercest of the pointers, lying\n",
      "under a window, with swelled head and bleeding ear. I opened the wicket\n",
      "and ran to the door, knocking vehemently for admittance. A woman whom I\n",
      "knew, and who formerly lived at Gimmerton, answered: she had been\n",
      "servant there since the death of Mr. Earnshaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah,” said she, “you are come a-seeking your little mistress! Don’t be\n",
      "frightened. She’s here safe: but I’m glad it isn’t the master.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is not at home then, is he?” I panted, quite breathless with quick\n",
      "walking and alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no,” she replied: “both he and Joseph are off, and I think they\n",
      "won’t return this hour or more. Step in and rest you a bit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I entered, and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth, rocking\n",
      "herself in a little chair that had been her mother’s when a child. Her\n",
      "hat was hung against the wall, and she seemed perfectly at home,\n",
      "laughing and chattering, in the best spirits imaginable, to Hareton—now\n",
      "a great, strong lad of eighteen—who stared at her with considerable\n",
      "curiosity and astonishment: comprehending precious little of the fluent\n",
      "succession of remarks and questions which her tongue never ceased\n",
      "pouring forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well, Miss!” I exclaimed, concealing my joy under an angry\n",
      "countenance. “This is your last ride, till papa comes back. I’ll not\n",
      "trust you over the threshold again, you naughty, naughty girl!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aha, Ellen!” she cried, gaily, jumping up and running to my side. “I\n",
      "shall have a pretty story to tell to-night; and so you’ve found me out.\n",
      "Have you ever been here in your life before?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Put that hat on, and home at once,” said I. “I’m dreadfully grieved at\n",
      "you, Miss Cathy: you’ve done extremely wrong! It’s no use pouting and\n",
      "crying: that won’t repay the trouble I’ve had, scouring the country\n",
      "after you. To think how Mr. Linton charged me to keep you in; and you\n",
      "stealing off so! It shows you are a cunning little fox, and nobody will\n",
      "put faith in you any more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What have I done?” sobbed she, instantly checked. “Papa charged me\n",
      "nothing: he’ll not scold me, Ellen—he’s never cross, like you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, come!” I repeated. “I’ll tie the riband. Now, let us have no\n",
      "petulance. Oh, for shame! You thirteen years old, and such a baby!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her head, and\n",
      "retreating to the chimney out of my reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay,” said the servant, “don’t be hard on the bonny lass, Mrs. Dean.\n",
      "We made her stop: she’d fain have ridden forwards, afeard you should be\n",
      "uneasy. Hareton offered to go with her, and I thought he should: it’s a\n",
      "wild road over the hills.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hareton, during the discussion, stood with his hands in his pockets,\n",
      "too awkward to speak; though he looked as if he did not relish my\n",
      "intrusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How long am I to wait?” I continued, disregarding the woman’s\n",
      "interference. “It will be dark in ten minutes. Where is the pony, Miss\n",
      "Cathy? And where is Phoenix? I shall leave you, unless you be quick; so\n",
      "please yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The pony is in the yard,” she replied, “and Phoenix is shut in there.\n",
      "He’s bitten—and so is Charlie. I was going to tell you all about it;\n",
      "but you are in a bad temper, and don’t deserve to hear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I picked up her hat, and approached to reinstate it; but perceiving\n",
      "that the people of the house took her part, she commenced capering\n",
      "round the room; and on my giving chase, ran like a mouse over and under\n",
      "and behind the furniture, rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue.\n",
      "Hareton and the woman laughed, and she joined them, and waxed more\n",
      "impertinent still; till I cried, in great irritation,—“Well, Miss\n",
      "Cathy, if you were aware whose house this is you’d be glad enough to\n",
      "get out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s _your_ father’s, isn’t it?” said she, turning to Hareton.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay,” he replied, looking down, and blushing bashfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes, though they were just\n",
      "his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whose then—your master’s?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "He coloured deeper, with a different feeling, muttered an oath, and\n",
      "turned away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is his master?” continued the tiresome girl, appealing to me. “He\n",
      "talked about ‘our house,’ and ‘our folk.’ I thought he had been the\n",
      "owner’s son. And he never said Miss: he should have done, shouldn’t he,\n",
      "if he’s a servant?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hareton grew black as a thunder-cloud at this childish speech. I\n",
      "silently shook my questioner, and at last succeeded in equipping her\n",
      "for departure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, get my horse,” she said, addressing her unknown kinsman as she\n",
      "would one of the stable-boys at the Grange. “And you may come with me.\n",
      "I want to see where the goblin-hunter rises in the marsh, and to hear\n",
      "about the _fairishes_, as you call them: but make haste! What’s the\n",
      "matter? Get my horse, I say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll see thee damned before I be _thy_ servant!” growled the lad.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll see me _what?_” asked Catherine in surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Damned—thou saucy witch!” he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There, Miss Cathy! you see you have got into pretty company,” I\n",
      "interposed. “Nice words to be used to a young lady! Pray don’t begin to\n",
      "dispute with him. Come, let us seek for Minny ourselves, and begone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Ellen,” cried she, staring fixed in astonishment, “how dare he\n",
      "speak so to me? Mustn’t he be made to do as I ask him? You wicked\n",
      "creature, I shall tell papa what you said.—Now, then!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hareton did not appear to feel this threat; so the tears sprang into\n",
      "her eyes with indignation. “You bring the pony,” she exclaimed, turning\n",
      "to the woman, “and let my dog free this moment!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Softly, Miss,” answered the addressed. “You’ll lose nothing by being\n",
      "civil. Though Mr. Hareton, there, be not the master’s son, he’s your\n",
      "cousin: and I was never hired to serve you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_He_ my cousin!” cried Cathy, with a scornful laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, indeed,” responded her reprover.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Ellen! don’t let them say such things,” she pursued in great\n",
      "trouble. “Papa is gone to fetch my cousin from London: my cousin is a\n",
      "gentleman’s son. That my—” she stopped, and wept outright; upset at the\n",
      "bare notion of relationship with such a clown.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush, hush!” I whispered; “people can have many cousins and of all\n",
      "sorts, Miss Cathy, without being any the worse for it; only they\n",
      "needn’t keep their company, if they be disagreeable and bad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s not—he’s not my cousin, Ellen!” she went on, gathering fresh\n",
      "grief from reflection, and flinging herself into my arms for refuge\n",
      "from the idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations;\n",
      "having no doubt of Linton’s approaching arrival, communicated by the\n",
      "former, being reported to Mr. Heathcliff; and feeling as confident that\n",
      "Catherine’s first thought on her father’s return would be to seek an\n",
      "explanation of the latter’s assertion concerning her rude-bred kindred.\n",
      "Hareton, recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant,\n",
      "seemed moved by her distress; and, having fetched the pony round to the\n",
      "door, he took, to propitiate her, a fine crooked-legged terrier whelp\n",
      "from the kennel, and putting it into her hand, bid her whist! for he\n",
      "meant nought. Pausing in her lamentations, she surveyed him with a\n",
      "glance of awe and horror, then burst forth anew.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor\n",
      "fellow; who was a well-made, athletic youth, good-looking in features,\n",
      "and stout and healthy, but attired in garments befitting his daily\n",
      "occupations of working on the farm and lounging among the moors after\n",
      "rabbits and game. Still, I thought I could detect in his physiognomy a\n",
      "mind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed. Good\n",
      "things lost amid a wilderness of weeds, to be sure, whose rankness far\n",
      "over-topped their neglected growth; yet, notwithstanding, evidence of a\n",
      "wealthy soil, that might yield luxuriant crops under other and\n",
      "favourable circumstances. Mr. Heathcliff, I believe, had not treated\n",
      "him physically ill; thanks to his fearless nature, which offered no\n",
      "temptation to that course of oppression: he had none of the timid\n",
      "susceptibility that would have given zest to ill-treatment, in\n",
      "Heathcliff’s judgment. He appeared to have bent his malevolence on\n",
      "making him a brute: he was never taught to read or write; never rebuked\n",
      "for any bad habit which did not annoy his keeper; never led a single\n",
      "step towards virtue, or guarded by a single precept against vice. And\n",
      "from what I heard, Joseph contributed much to his deterioration, by a\n",
      "narrow-minded partiality which prompted him to flatter and pet him, as\n",
      "a boy, because he was the head of the old family. And as he had been in\n",
      "the habit of accusing Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, when children,\n",
      "of putting the master past his patience, and compelling him to seek\n",
      "solace in drink by what he termed their “offald ways,” so at present he\n",
      "laid the whole burden of Hareton’s faults on the shoulders of the\n",
      "usurper of his property. If the lad swore, he wouldn’t correct him: nor\n",
      "however culpably he behaved. It gave Joseph satisfaction, apparently,\n",
      "to watch him go the worst lengths: he allowed that the lad was ruined:\n",
      "that his soul was abandoned to perdition; but then he reflected that\n",
      "Heathcliff must answer for it. Hareton’s blood would be required at his\n",
      "hands; and there lay immense consolation in that thought. Joseph had\n",
      "instilled into him a pride of name, and of his lineage; he would, had\n",
      "he dared, have fostered hate between him and the present owner of the\n",
      "Heights: but his dread of that owner amounted to superstition; and he\n",
      "confined his feelings regarding him to muttered innuendoes and private\n",
      "comminations. I don’t pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode\n",
      "of living customary in those days at Wuthering Heights: I only speak\n",
      "from hearsay; for I saw little. The villagers affirmed Mr. Heathcliff\n",
      "was _near_, and a cruel hard landlord to his tenants; but the house,\n",
      "inside, had regained its ancient aspect of comfort under female\n",
      "management, and the scenes of riot common in Hindley’s time were not\n",
      "now enacted within its walls. The master was too gloomy to seek\n",
      "companionship with any people, good or bad; and he is yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, however, is not making progress with my story. Miss Cathy\n",
      "rejected the peace-offering of the terrier, and demanded her own dogs,\n",
      "Charlie and Phoenix. They came limping and hanging their heads; and we\n",
      "set out for home, sadly out of sorts, every one of us. I could not\n",
      "wring from my little lady how she had spent the day; except that, as I\n",
      "supposed, the goal of her pilgrimage was Penistone Crags; and she\n",
      "arrived without adventure to the gate of the farmhouse, when Hareton\n",
      "happened to issue forth, attended by some canine followers, who\n",
      "attacked her train. They had a smart battle, before their owners could\n",
      "separate them: that formed an introduction. Catherine told Hareton who\n",
      "she was, and where she was going; and asked him to show her the way:\n",
      "finally, beguiling him to accompany her. He opened the mysteries of the\n",
      "Fairy Cave, and twenty other queer places. But, being in disgrace, I\n",
      "was not favoured with a description of the interesting objects she saw.\n",
      "I could gather, however, that her guide had been a favourite till she\n",
      "hurt his feelings by addressing him as a servant; and Heathcliff’s\n",
      "housekeeper hurt hers by calling him her cousin. Then the language he\n",
      "had held to her rankled in her heart; she who was always “love,” and\n",
      "“darling,” and “queen,” and “angel,” with everybody at the Grange, to\n",
      "be insulted so shockingly by a stranger! She did not comprehend it; and\n",
      "hard work I had to obtain a promise that she would not lay the\n",
      "grievance before her father. I explained how he objected to the whole\n",
      "household at the Heights, and how sorry he would be to find she had\n",
      "been there; but I insisted most on the fact, that if she revealed my\n",
      "negligence of his orders, he would perhaps be so angry that I should\n",
      "have to leave; and Cathy couldn’t bear that prospect: she pledged her\n",
      "word, and kept it for my sake. After all, she was a sweet little girl.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A letter, edged with black, announced the day of my master’s return.\n",
      "Isabella was dead; and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his\n",
      "daughter, and arrange a room, and other accommodations, for his\n",
      "youthful nephew. Catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming\n",
      "her father back; and indulged most sanguine anticipations of the\n",
      "innumerable excellencies of her “real” cousin. The evening of their\n",
      "expected arrival came. Since early morning she had been busy ordering\n",
      "her own small affairs; and now attired in her new black frock—poor\n",
      "thing! her aunt’s death impressed her with no definite sorrow—she\n",
      "obliged me, by constant worrying, to walk with her down through the\n",
      "grounds to meet them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Linton is just six months younger than I am,” she chattered, as we\n",
      "strolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf, under\n",
      "shadow of the trees. “How delightful it will be to have him for a\n",
      "playfellow! Aunt Isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair; it\n",
      "was lighter than mine—more flaxen, and quite as fine. I have it\n",
      "carefully preserved in a little glass box; and I’ve often thought what\n",
      "a pleasure it would be to see its owner. Oh! I am happy—and papa, dear,\n",
      "dear papa! Come, Ellen, let us run! come, run.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She ran, and returned and ran again, many times before my sober\n",
      "footsteps reached the gate, and then she seated herself on the grassy\n",
      "bank beside the path, and tried to wait patiently; but that was\n",
      "impossible: she couldn’t be still a minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How long they are!” she exclaimed. “Ah, I see some dust on the\n",
      "road—they are coming! No! When will they be here? May we not go a\n",
      "little way—half a mile, Ellen, only just half a mile? Do say yes, to\n",
      "that clump of birches at the turn!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I refused staunchly. At length her suspense was ended: the travelling\n",
      "carriage rolled in sight. Miss Cathy shrieked and stretched out her\n",
      "arms as soon as she caught her father’s face looking from the window.\n",
      "He descended, nearly as eager as herself; and a considerable interval\n",
      "elapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves. While\n",
      "they exchanged caresses I took a peep in to see after Linton. He was\n",
      "asleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm, fur-lined cloak, as if it had\n",
      "been winter. A pale, delicate, effeminate boy, who might have been\n",
      "taken for my master’s younger brother, so strong was the resemblance:\n",
      "but there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect that Edgar Linton\n",
      "never had. The latter saw me looking; and having shaken hands, advised\n",
      "me to close the door, and leave him undisturbed; for the journey had\n",
      "fatigued him. Cathy would fain have taken one glance, but her father\n",
      "told her to come, and they walked together up the park, while I\n",
      "hastened before to prepare the servants.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, darling,” said Mr. Linton, addressing his daughter, as they\n",
      "halted at the bottom of the front steps: “your cousin is not so strong\n",
      "or so merry as you are, and he has lost his mother, remember, a very\n",
      "short time since; therefore, don’t expect him to play and run about\n",
      "with you directly. And don’t harass him much by talking: let him be\n",
      "quiet this evening, at least, will you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, yes, papa,” answered Catherine: “but I do want to see him; and he\n",
      "hasn’t once looked out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The carriage stopped; and the sleeper being roused, was lifted to the\n",
      "ground by his uncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is your cousin Cathy, Linton,” he said, putting their little\n",
      "hands together. “She’s fond of you already; and mind you don’t grieve\n",
      "her by crying to-night. Try to be cheerful now; the travelling is at an\n",
      "end, and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you\n",
      "please.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let me go to bed, then,” answered the boy, shrinking from Catherine’s\n",
      "salute; and he put his fingers to his eyes to remove incipient tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, come, there’s a good child,” I whispered, leading him in.\n",
      "“You’ll make her weep too—see how sorry she is for you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not know whether it was sorrow for him, but his cousin put on as\n",
      "sad a countenance as himself, and returned to her father. All three\n",
      "entered, and mounted to the library, where tea was laid ready. I\n",
      "proceeded to remove Linton’s cap and mantle, and placed him on a chair\n",
      "by the table; but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh.\n",
      "My master inquired what was the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t sit on a chair,” sobbed the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go to the sofa, then, and Ellen shall bring you some tea,” answered\n",
      "his uncle patiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had been greatly tried, during the journey, I felt convinced, by his\n",
      "fretful ailing charge. Linton slowly trailed himself off, and lay down.\n",
      "Cathy carried a footstool and her cup to his side. At first she sat\n",
      "silent; but that could not last: she had resolved to make a pet of her\n",
      "little cousin, as she would have him to be; and she commenced stroking\n",
      "his curls, and kissing his cheek, and offering him tea in her saucer,\n",
      "like a baby. This pleased him, for he was not much better: he dried his\n",
      "eyes, and lightened into a faint smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, he’ll do very well,” said the master to me, after watching them a\n",
      "minute. “Very well, if we can keep him, Ellen. The company of a child\n",
      "of his own age will instil new spirit into him soon, and by wishing for\n",
      "strength he’ll gain it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, if we can keep him!” I mused to myself; and sore misgivings came\n",
      "over me that there was slight hope of that. And then, I thought, how\n",
      "ever will that weakling live at Wuthering Heights? Between his father\n",
      "and Hareton, what playmates and instructors they’ll be. Our doubts were\n",
      "presently decided—even earlier than I expected. I had just taken the\n",
      "children upstairs, after tea was finished, and seen Linton asleep—he\n",
      "would not suffer me to leave him till that was the case—I had come\n",
      "down, and was standing by the table in the hall, lighting a bedroom\n",
      "candle for Mr. Edgar, when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and\n",
      "informed me that Mr. Heathcliff’s servant Joseph was at the door, and\n",
      "wished to speak with the master.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall ask him what he wants first,” I said, in considerable\n",
      "trepidation. “A very unlikely hour to be troubling people, and the\n",
      "instant they have returned from a long journey. I don’t think the\n",
      "master can see him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joseph had advanced through the kitchen as I uttered these words, and\n",
      "now presented himself in the hall. He was donned in his Sunday\n",
      "garments, with his most sanctimonious and sourest face, and, holding\n",
      "his hat in one hand, and his stick in the other, he proceeded to clean\n",
      "his shoes on the mat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good-evening, Joseph,” I said, coldly. “What business brings you here\n",
      "to-night?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s Maister Linton I mun spake to,” he answered, waving me\n",
      "disdainfully aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Linton is going to bed; unless you have something particular to\n",
      "say, I’m sure he won’t hear it now,” I continued. “You had better sit\n",
      "down in there, and entrust your message to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which is his rahm?” pursued the fellow, surveying the range of closed\n",
      "doors.\n",
      "\n",
      "I perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation, so very reluctantly I\n",
      "went up to the library, and announced the unseasonable visitor,\n",
      "advising that he should be dismissed till next day. Mr. Linton had no\n",
      "time to empower me to do so, for Joseph mounted close at my heels, and,\n",
      "pushing into the apartment, planted himself at the far side of the\n",
      "table, with his two fists clapped on the head of his stick, and began\n",
      "in an elevated tone, as if anticipating opposition—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hathecliff has sent me for his lad, and I munn’t goa back ’bout him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Edgar Linton was silent a minute; an expression of exceeding sorrow\n",

      "account; but, recalling Isabella’s hopes and fears, and anxious wishes\n",
      "for her son, and her commendations of him to his care, he grieved\n",
      "bitterly at the prospect of yielding him up, and searched in his heart\n",
      "how it might be avoided. No plan offered itself: the very exhibition of\n",
      "any desire to keep him would have rendered the claimant more\n",
      "peremptory: there was nothing left but to resign him. However, he was\n",
      "not going to rouse him from his sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell Mr. Heathcliff,” he answered calmly, “that his son shall come to\n",
      "Wuthering Heights to-morrow. He is in bed, and too tired to go the\n",
      "distance now. You may also tell him that the mother of Linton desired\n",
      "him to remain under my guardianship; and, at present, his health is\n",
      "very precarious.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Noa!” said Joseph, giving a thud with his prop on the floor, and\n",
      "assuming an authoritative air. “Noa! that means naught. Hathecliff maks\n",
      "noa ’count o’ t’ mother, nor ye norther; but he’ll hev his lad; und I\n",
      "mun tak’ him—soa now ye knaw!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shall not to-night!” answered Linton decisively. “Walk down stairs\n",
      "at once, and repeat to your master what I have said. Ellen, show him\n",
      "down. Go—”\n",
      "\n",
      "And, aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm, he rid the room\n",
      "of him and closed the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Varrah weell!” shouted Joseph, as he slowly drew off. “To-morn, he’s\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled, Mr. Linton\n",
      "commissioned me to take the boy home early, on Catherine’s pony; and,\n",
      "said he—“As we shall now have no influence over his destiny, good or\n",
      "bad, you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter: she\n",
      "cannot associate with him hereafter, and it is better for her to remain\n",
      "in ignorance of his proximity; lest she should be restless, and anxious\n",
      "to visit the Heights. Merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly,\n",
      "and he has been obliged to leave us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Linton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five o’clock,\n",
      "and astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further\n",
      "travelling; but I softened off the matter by stating that he was going\n",
      "to spend some time with his father, Mr. Heathcliff, who wished to see\n",
      "him so much, he did not like to defer the pleasure till he should\n",
      "recover from his late journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My father!” he cried, in strange perplexity. “Mamma never told me I\n",
      "had a father. Where does he live? I’d rather stay with uncle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He lives a little distance from the Grange,” I replied; “just beyond\n",
      "those hills: not so far, but you may walk over here when you get\n",
      "hearty. And you should be glad to go home, and to see him. You must try\n",
      "to love him, as you did your mother, and then he will love you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But why have I not heard of him before?” asked Linton. “Why didn’t\n",
      "mamma and he live together, as other people do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He had business to keep him in the north,” I answered, “and your\n",
      "mother’s health required her to reside in the south.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And why didn’t mamma speak to me about him?” persevered the child.\n",
      "“She often talked of uncle, and I learnt to love him long ago. How am I\n",
      "to love papa? I don’t know him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, all children love their parents,” I said. “Your mother, perhaps,\n",
      "thought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to\n",
      "you. Let us make haste. An early ride on such a beautiful morning is\n",
      "much preferable to an hour’s more sleep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is _she_ to go with us,” he demanded, “the little girl I saw\n",
      "yesterday?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not now,” replied I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is uncle?” he continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I shall be your companion there,” I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Linton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won’t go without uncle,” he cried at length: “I can’t tell where you\n",
      "mean to take me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to\n",
      "meet his father; still he obstinately resisted any progress towards\n",
      "dressing, and I had to call for my master’s assistance in coaxing him\n",
      "out of bed. The poor thing was finally got off, with several delusive\n",
      "assurances that his absence should be short: that Mr. Edgar and Cathy\n",
      "would visit him, and other promises, equally ill-founded, which I\n",
      "invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way. The pure\n",
      "heather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and the gentle canter of\n",
      "Minny, relieved his despondency after a while. He began to put\n",
      "questions concerning his new home, and its inhabitants, with greater\n",
      "interest and liveliness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is Wuthering Heights as pleasant a place as Thrushcross Grange?” he\n",
      "inquired, turning to take a last glance into the valley, whence a light\n",
      "mist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not so buried in trees,” I replied, “and it is not quite so\n",
      "large, but you can see the country beautifully all round; and the air\n",
      "is healthier for you—fresher and drier. You will, perhaps, think the\n",
      "building old and dark at first; though it is a respectable house: the\n",
      "next best in the neighbourhood. And you will have such nice rambles on\n",
      "the moors. Hareton Earnshaw—that is, Miss Cathy’s other cousin, and so\n",
      "yours in a manner—will show you all the sweetest spots; and you can\n",
      "bring a book in fine weather, and make a green hollow your study; and,\n",
      "now and then, your uncle may join you in a walk: he does, frequently,\n",
      "walk out on the hills.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what is my father like?” he asked. “Is he as young and handsome as\n",
      "uncle?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s as young,” said I; “but he has black hair and eyes, and looks\n",
      "sterner; and he is taller and bigger altogether. He’ll not seem to you\n",
      "so gentle and kind at first, perhaps, because it is not his way: still,\n",
      "mind you, be frank and cordial with him; and naturally he’ll be fonder\n",
      "of you than any uncle, for you are his own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Black hair and eyes!” mused Linton. “I can’t fancy him. Then I am not\n",
      "like him, am I?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not much,” I answered: not a morsel, I thought, surveying with regret\n",
      "the white complexion and slim frame of my companion, and his large\n",
      "languid eyes—his mother’s eyes, save that, unless a morbid touchiness\n",
      "kindled them a moment, they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How strange that he should never come to see mamma and me!” he\n",
      "murmured. “Has he ever seen me? If he has, I must have been a baby. I\n",
      "remember not a single thing about him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, Master Linton,” said I, “three hundred miles is a great distance;\n",
      "and ten years seem very different in length to a grown-up person\n",
      "compared with what they do to you. It is probable Mr. Heathcliff\n",
      "proposed going from summer to summer, but never found a convenient\n",
      "opportunity; and now it is too late. Don’t trouble him with questions\n",
      "on the subject: it will disturb him, for no good.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder\n",
      "of the ride, till we halted before the farmhouse garden-gate. I watched\n",
      "to catch his impressions in his countenance. He surveyed the carved\n",
      "front and low-browed lattices, the straggling gooseberry-bushes and\n",
      "crooked firs, with solemn intentness, and then shook his head: his\n",
      "private feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode.\n",
      "But he had sense to postpone complaining: there might be compensation\n",
      "within. Before he dismounted, I went and opened the door. It was\n",
      "half-past six; the family had just finished breakfast: the servant was\n",
      "clearing and wiping down the table. Joseph stood by his master’s chair\n",
      "telling some tale concerning a lame horse; and Hareton was preparing\n",
      "for the hayfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hallo, Nelly!” said Mr. Heathcliff, when he saw me. “I feared I should\n",
      "have to come down and fetch my property myself. You’ve brought it, have\n",
      "you? Let us see what we can make of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He got up and strode to the door: Hareton and Joseph followed in gaping\n",
      "curiosity. Poor Linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the\n",
      "three.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure-ly,” said Joseph after a grave inspection, “he’s swopped wi’ ye,\n",
      "Maister, an’ yon’s his lass!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Heathcliff, having stared his son into an ague of confusion, uttered a\n",
      "scornful laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "“God! what a beauty! what a lovely, charming thing!” he exclaimed.\n",
      "“Hav’n’t they reared it on snails and sour milk, Nelly? Oh, damn my\n",
      "soul! but that’s worse than I expected—and the devil knows I was not\n",
      "sanguine!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I bid the trembling and bewildered child get down, and enter. He did\n",
      "not thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his father’s speech, or\n",
      "whether it were intended for him: indeed, he was not yet certain that\n",
      "the grim, sneering stranger was his father. But he clung to me with\n",
      "growing trepidation; and on Mr. Heathcliff’s taking a seat and bidding\n",
      "him “come hither” he hid his face on my shoulder and wept.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tut, tut!” said Heathcliff, stretching out a hand and dragging him\n",
      "roughly between his knees, and then holding up his head by the chin.\n",
      "“None of that nonsense! We’re not going to hurt thee, Linton—isn’t that\n",
      "thy name? Thou art thy mother’s child, entirely! Where is _my_ share in\n",
      "thee, puling chicken?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He took off the boy’s cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls, felt\n",
      "his slender arms and his small fingers; during which examination Linton\n",
      "ceased crying, and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know me?” asked Heathcliff, having satisfied himself that the\n",
      "limbs were all equally frail and feeble.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Linton, with a gaze of vacant fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ve heard of me, I daresay?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” he replied again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No! What a shame of your mother, never to waken your filial regard for\n",
      "me! You are my son, then, I’ll tell you; and your mother was a wicked\n",
      "slut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed.\n",
      "Now, don’t wince, and colour up! Though it _is_ something to see you\n",
      "have not white blood. Be a good lad; and I’ll do for you. Nelly, if you\n",
      "be tired you may sit down; if not, get home again. I guess you’ll\n",
      "report what you hear and see to the cipher at the Grange; and this\n",
      "thing won’t be settled while you linger about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” replied I, “I hope you’ll be kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff,\n",
      "or you’ll not keep him long; and he’s all you have akin in the wide\n",
      "world, that you will ever know—remember.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll be _very_ kind to him, you needn’t fear,” he said, laughing.\n",
      "“Only nobody else must be kind to him: I’m jealous of monopolising his\n",
      "affection. And, to begin my kindness, Joseph, bring the lad some\n",
      "breakfast. Hareton, you infernal calf, begone to your work. Yes, Nell,”\n",
      "he added, when they had departed, “my son is prospective owner of your\n",
      "place, and I should not wish him to die till I was certain of being his\n",
      "successor. Besides, he’s _mine_, and I want the triumph of seeing _my_\n",
      "descendant fairly lord of their estates; my child hiring their children\n",
      "to till their fathers’ lands for wages. That is the sole consideration\n",
      "which can make me endure the whelp: I despise him for himself, and hate\n",
      "him for the memories he revives! But that consideration is sufficient:\n",
      "he’s as safe with me, and shall be tended as carefully as your master\n",
      "tends his own. I have a room upstairs, furnished for him in handsome\n",
      "style; I’ve engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week, from\n",
      "twenty miles’ distance, to teach him what he pleases to learn. I’ve\n",
      "ordered Hareton to obey him: and in fact I’ve arranged everything with\n",
      "a view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him, above his\n",
      "associates. I do regret, however, that he so little deserves the\n",
      "trouble: if I wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a\n",
      "worthy object of pride; and I’m bitterly disappointed with the\n",
      "whey-faced, whining wretch!”\n",
      "\n",
      "While he was speaking, Joseph returned bearing a basin of\n",
      "milk-porridge, and placed it before Linton: who stirred round the\n",
      "homely mess with a look of aversion, and affirmed he could not eat it.\n",
      "I saw the old man-servant shared largely in his master’s scorn of the\n",
      "child; though he was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart,\n",
      "because Heathcliff plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cannot ate it?” repeated he, peering in Linton’s face, and subduing\n",
      "his voice to a whisper, for fear of being overheard. “But Maister\n",
      "Hareton nivir ate naught else, when he wer a little ’un; and what wer\n",
      "gooid eneugh for him’s gooid eneugh for ye, I’s rayther think!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I _sha’n’t_ eat it!” answered Linton, snappishly. “Take it away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Joseph snatched up the food indignantly, and brought it to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there aught ails th’ victuals?” he asked, thrusting the tray under\n",
      "Heathcliff’s nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What should ail them?” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wah!” answered Joseph, “yon dainty chap says he cannut ate ’em. But I\n",
      "guess it’s raight! His mother wer just soa—we wer a’most too mucky to\n",
      "sow t’ corn for makking her breead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t mention his mother to me,” said the master, angrily. “Get him\n",
      "something that he can eat, that’s all. What is his usual food, Nelly?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I suggested boiled milk or tea; and the housekeeper received\n",
      "instructions to prepare some. Come, I reflected, his father’s\n",
      "selfishness may contribute to his comfort. He perceives his delicate\n",
      "constitution, and the necessity of treating him tolerably. I’ll console\n",
      "Mr. Edgar by acquainting him with the turn Heathcliff’s humour has\n",
      "taken. Having no excuse for lingering longer, I slipped out, while\n",
      "Linton was engaged in timidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly\n",
      "sheep-dog. But he was too much on the alert to be cheated: as I closed\n",
      "the door, I heard a cry, and a frantic repetition of the words—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t leave me! I’ll not stay here! I’ll not stay here!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the latch was raised and fell: they did not suffer him to come\n",
      "forth. I mounted Minny, and urged her to a trot; and so my brief\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had sad work with little Cathy that day: she rose in high glee,\n",
      "eager to join her cousin, and such passionate tears and lamentations\n",
      "followed the news of his departure that Edgar himself was obliged to\n",
      "soothe her, by affirming he should come back soon: he added, however,\n",
      "“if I can get him”; and there were no hopes of that. This promise\n",
      "poorly pacified her; but time was more potent; and though still at\n",
      "intervals she inquired of her father when Linton would return, before\n",
      "she did see him again his features had waxed so dim in her memory that\n",
      "she did not recognise him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I chanced to encounter the housekeeper of Wuthering Heights, in\n",
      "paying business visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask how the young master\n",
      "got on; for he lived almost as secluded as Catherine herself, and was\n",
      "never to be seen. I could gather from her that he continued in weak\n",
      "health, and was a tiresome inmate. She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to\n",
      "dislike him ever longer and worse, though he took some trouble to\n",
      "conceal it: he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice, and could\n",
      "not do at all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes\n",
      "together. There seldom passed much talk between them: Linton learnt his\n",
      "lessons and spent his evenings in a small apartment they called the\n",
      "parlour: or else lay in bed all day: for he was constantly getting\n",
      "coughs, and colds, and aches, and pains of some sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I never knew such a faint-hearted creature,” added the woman; “nor\n",
      "one so careful of hisseln. He _will_ go on, if I leave the window open\n",
      "a bit late in the evening. Oh! it’s killing, a breath of night air! And\n",
      "he must have a fire in the middle of summer; and Joseph’s bacca-pipe is\n",
      "poison; and he must always have sweets and dainties, and always milk,\n",
      "milk for ever—heeding naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter;\n",
      "and there he’ll sit, wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the\n",
      "fire, with some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at; and\n",
      "if Hareton, for pity, comes to amuse him—Hareton is not bad-natured,\n",
      "though he’s rough—they’re sure to part, one swearing and the other\n",
      "crying. I believe the master would relish Earnshaw’s thrashing him to a\n",
      "mummy, if he were not his son; and I’m certain he would be fit to turn\n",
      "him out of doors, if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln. But\n",

      "parlour, and should Linton show those ways in the house where he is, he\n",
      "sends him upstairs directly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I divined, from this account, that utter lack of sympathy had rendered\n",
      "young Heathcliff selfish and disagreeable, if he were not so\n",
      "originally; and my interest in him, consequently, decayed: though still\n",
      "I was moved with a sense of grief at his lot, and a wish that he had\n",
      "been left with us. Mr. Edgar encouraged me to gain information: he\n",
      "thought a great deal about him, I fancy, and would have run some risk\n",
      "to see him; and he told me once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever\n",
      "came into the village? She said he had only been twice, on horseback,\n",
      "accompanying his father; and both times he pretended to be quite\n",
      "knocked up for three or four days afterwards. That housekeeper left, if\n",
      "I recollect rightly, two years after he came; and another, whom I did\n",

      "\n",
      "Time wore on at the Grange in its former pleasant way till Miss Cathy\n",
      "reached sixteen. On the anniversary of her birth we never manifested\n",
      "any signs of rejoicing, because it was also the anniversary of my late\n",

      "again like a young greyhound; and, at first, I found plenty of\n",
      "entertainment in listening to the larks singing far and near, and\n",
      "enjoying the sweet, warm sunshine; and watching her, my pet and my\n",
      "delight, with her golden ringlets flying loose behind, and her bright\n",
      "cheek, as soft and pure in its bloom as a wild rose, and her eyes\n",
      "radiant with cloudless pleasure. She was a happy creature, and an\n",
      "angel, in those days. It’s a pity she could not be content.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well,” said I, “where are your moor-game, Miss Cathy? We should be at\n",
      "them: the Grange park-fence is a great way off now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, a little further—only a little further, Ellen,” was her answer,\n",
      "continually. “Climb to that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time\n",
      "you reach the other side I shall have raised the birds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass, that, at\n",
      "length, I began to be weary, and told her we must halt, and retrace our\n",
      "steps. I shouted to her, as she had outstripped me a long way; she\n",
      "either did not hear or did not regard, for she still sprang on, and I\n",
      "was compelled to follow. Finally, she dived into a hollow; and before I\n",
      "came in sight of her again, she was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights\n",
      "than her own home; and I beheld a couple of persons arrest her, one of\n",
      "whom I felt convinced was Mr. Heathcliff himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering, or, at least, hunting\n",
      "out the nests of the grouse. The Heights were Heathcliff’s land, and he\n",
      "was reproving the poacher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve neither taken any nor found any,” she said, as I toiled to them,\n",
      "expanding her hands in corroboration of the statement. “I didn’t mean\n",
      "to take them; but papa told me there were quantities up here, and I\n",
      "wished to see the eggs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Heathcliff glanced at me with an ill-meaning smile, expressing his\n",
      "acquaintance with the party, and, consequently, his malevolence towards\n",
      "it, and demanded who “papa” was?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange,” she replied. “I thought you did not\n",
      "know me, or you wouldn’t have spoken in that way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected, then?” he said,\n",
      "sarcastically.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what are you?” inquired Catherine, gazing curiously on the\n",
      "speaker. “That man I’ve seen before. Is he your son?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She pointed to Hareton, the other individual, who had gained nothing\n",
      "but increased bulk and strength by the addition of two years to his\n",
      "age: he seemed as awkward and rough as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Cathy,” I interrupted, “it will be three hours instead of one\n",
      "that we are out, presently. We really must go back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, that man is not my son,” answered Heathcliff, pushing me aside.\n",
      "“But I have one, and you have seen him before too; and, though your\n",
      "nurse is in a hurry, I think both you and she would be the better for a\n",
      "little rest. Will you just turn this nab of heath, and walk into my\n",
      "house? You’ll get home earlier for the ease; and you shall receive a\n",
      "kind welcome.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I whispered Catherine that she mustn’t, on any account, accede to the\n",
      "proposal: it was entirely out of the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?” she asked, aloud. “I’m tired of running, and the ground is dewy:\n",
      "I can’t sit here. Let us go, Ellen. Besides, he says I have seen his\n",
      "son. He’s mistaken, I think; but I guess where he lives: at the\n",
      "farmhouse I visited in coming from Penistone Crags. Don’t you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do. Come, Nelly, hold your tongue—it will be a treat for her to look\n",
      "in on us. Hareton, get forwards with the lass. You shall walk with me,\n",
      "Nelly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, she’s not going to any such place,” I cried, struggling to release\n",
      "my arm, which he had seized: but she was almost at the door-stones\n",
      "already, scampering round the brow at full speed. Her appointed\n",
      "companion did not pretend to escort her: he shied off by the road-side,\n",
      "and vanished.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Heathcliff, it’s very wrong,” I continued: “you know you mean no\n",
      "good. And there she’ll see Linton, and all will be told as soon as ever\n",
      "we return; and I shall have the blame.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want her to see Linton,” he answered; “he’s looking better these few\n",
      "days; it’s not often he’s fit to be seen. And we’ll soon persuade her\n",
      "to keep the visit secret: where is the harm of it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The harm of it is, that her father would hate me if he found I\n",
      "suffered her to enter your house; and I am convinced you have a bad\n",
      "design in encouraging her to do so,” I replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My design is as honest as possible. I’ll inform you of its whole\n",
      "scope,” he said. “That the two cousins may fall in love, and get\n",
      "married. I’m acting generously to your master: his young chit has no\n",
      "expectations, and should she second my wishes she’ll be provided for at\n",
      "once as joint successor with Linton.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If Linton died,” I answered, “and his life is quite uncertain,\n",
      "Catherine would be the heir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, she would not,” he said. “There is no clause in the will to secure\n",
      "it so: his property would go to me; but, to prevent disputes, I desire\n",
      "their union, and am resolved to bring it about.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I’m resolved she shall never approach your house with me again,” I\n",
      "returned, as we reached the gate, where Miss Cathy waited our coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heathcliff bade me be quiet; and, preceding us up the path, hastened to\n",
      "open the door. My young lady gave him several looks, as if she could\n",
      "not exactly make up her mind what to think of him; but now he smiled\n",
      "when he met her eye, and softened his voice in addressing her; and I\n",
      "was foolish enough to imagine the memory of her mother might disarm him\n",
      "from desiring her injury. Linton stood on the hearth. He had been out\n",
      "walking in the fields, for his cap was on, and he was calling to Joseph\n",
      "to bring him dry shoes. He had grown tall of his age, still wanting\n",
      "some months of sixteen. His features were pretty yet, and his eye and\n",
      "complexion brighter than I remembered them, though with merely\n",
      "temporary lustre borrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, who is that?” asked Mr. Heathcliff, turning to Cathy. “Can you\n",
      "tell?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your son?” she said, having doubtfully surveyed, first one and then\n",
      "the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, yes,” answered he: “but is this the only time you have beheld\n",
      "him? Think! Ah! you have a short memory. Linton, don’t you recall your\n",
      "cousin, that you used to tease us so with wishing to see?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What, Linton!” cried Cathy, kindling into joyful surprise at the name.\n",
      "“Is that little Linton? He’s taller than I am! Are you Linton?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The youth stepped forward, and acknowledged himself: she kissed him\n",
      "fervently, and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in\n",
      "the appearance of each. Catherine had reached her full height; her\n",
      "figure was both plump and slender, elastic as steel, and her whole\n",
      "aspect sparkling with health and spirits. Linton’s looks and movements\n",
      "were very languid, and his form extremely slight; but there was a grace\n",
      "in his manner that mitigated these defects, and rendered him not\n",
      "unpleasing. After exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him, his\n",
      "cousin went to Mr. Heathcliff, who lingered by the door, dividing his\n",
      "attention between the objects inside and those that lay without:\n",
      "pretending, that is, to observe the latter, and really noting the\n",
      "former alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you are my uncle, then!” she cried, reaching up to salute him. “I\n",
      "thought I liked you, though you were cross at first. Why don’t you\n",
      "visit at the Grange with Linton? To live all these years such close\n",
      "neighbours, and never see us, is odd: what have you done so for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I visited it once or twice too often before you were born,” he\n",
      "answered. “There—damn it! If you have any kisses to spare, give them to\n",
      "Linton: they are thrown away on me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Naughty Ellen!” exclaimed Catherine, flying to attack me next with her\n",
      "lavish caresses. “Wicked Ellen! to try to hinder me from entering. But\n",
      "I’ll take this walk every morning in future: may I, uncle? and\n",
      "sometimes bring papa. Won’t you be glad to see us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course,” replied the uncle, with a hardly suppressed grimace,\n",
      "resulting from his deep aversion to both the proposed visitors. “But\n",
      "stay,” he continued, turning towards the young lady. “Now I think of\n",
      "it, I’d better tell you. Mr. Linton has a prejudice against me: we\n",
      "quarrelled at one time of our lives, with unchristian ferocity; and, if\n",
      "you mention coming here to him, he’ll put a veto on your visits\n",
      "altogether. Therefore, you must not mention it, unless you be careless\n",
      "of seeing your cousin hereafter: you may come, if you will, but you\n",
      "must not mention it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why did you quarrel?” asked Catherine, considerably crestfallen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He thought me too poor to wed his sister,” answered Heathcliff, “and\n",
      "was grieved that I got her: his pride was hurt, and he’ll never forgive\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s wrong!” said the young lady: “some time I’ll tell him so. But\n",
      "Linton and I have no share in your quarrel. I’ll not come here, then;\n",
      "he shall come to the Grange.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will be too far for me,” murmured her cousin: “to walk four miles\n",
      "would kill me. No, come here, Miss Catherine, now and then: not every\n",
      "morning, but once or twice a week.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The father launched towards his son a glance of bitter contempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am afraid, Nelly, I shall lose my labour,” he muttered to me. “Miss\n",
      "Catherine, as the ninny calls her, will discover his value, and send\n",
      "him to the devil. Now, if it had been Hareton!—Do you know that, twenty\n",
      "times a day, I covet Hareton, with all his degradation? I’d have loved\n",
      "the lad had he been some one else. But I think he’s safe from _her_\n",
      "love. I’ll pit him against that paltry creature, unless it bestir\n",
      "itself briskly. We calculate it will scarcely last till it is eighteen.\n",
      "Oh, confound the vapid thing! He’s absorbed in drying his feet, and\n",
      "never looks at her.—Linton!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, father,” answered the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, not even a rabbit\n",
      "or a weasel’s nest? Take her into the garden, before you change your\n",
      "shoes; and into the stable to see your horse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wouldn’t you rather sit here?” asked Linton, addressing Cathy in a\n",
      "tone which expressed reluctance to move again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know,” she replied, casting a longing look to the door, and\n",
      "evidently eager to be active.\n",
      "\n",
      "He kept his seat, and shrank closer to the fire. Heathcliff rose, and\n",
      "went into the kitchen, and from thence to the yard, calling out for\n",
      "Hareton. Hareton responded, and presently the two re-entered. The young\n",
      "man had been washing himself, as was visible by the glow on his cheeks\n",
      "and his wetted hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I’ll ask _you_, uncle,” cried Miss Cathy, recollecting the\n",
      "housekeeper’s assertion. “That is not my cousin, is he?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” he replied, “your mother’s nephew. Don’t you like him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Catherine looked queer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he not a handsome lad?” he continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "The uncivil little thing stood on tiptoe, and whispered a sentence in\n",
      "Heathcliff’s ear. He laughed; Hareton darkened: I perceived he was very\n",
      "sensitive to suspected slights, and had obviously a dim notion of his\n",
      "inferiority. But his master or guardian chased the frown by exclaiming—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll be the favourite among us, Hareton! She says you are a—What was\n",
      "it? Well, something very flattering. Here! you go with her round the\n",
      "farm. And behave like a gentleman, mind! Don’t use any bad words; and\n",
      "don’t stare when the young lady is not looking at you, and be ready to\n",
      "hide your face when she is; and, when you speak, say your words slowly,\n",
      "and keep your hands out of your pockets. Be off, and entertain her as\n",
      "nicely as you can.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He watched the couple walking past the window. Earnshaw had his\n",
      "countenance completely averted from his companion. He seemed studying\n",
      "the familiar landscape with a stranger’s and an artist’s interest.\n",
      "Catherine took a sly look at him, expressing small admiration. She then\n",
      "turned her attention to seeking out objects of amusement for herself,\n",
      "and tripped merrily on, lilting a tune to supply the lack of\n",
      "conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve tied his tongue,” observed Heathcliff. “He’ll not venture a\n",
      "single syllable all the time! Nelly, you recollect me at his age—nay,\n",
      "some years younger. Did I ever look so stupid: so ‘gaumless,’ as Joseph\n",
      "calls it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Worse,” I replied, “because more sullen with it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve a pleasure in him,” he continued, reflecting aloud. “He has\n",
      "satisfied my expectations. If he were a born fool I should not enjoy it\n",
      "half so much. But he’s no fool; and I can sympathise with all his\n",
      "feelings, having felt them myself. I know what he suffers now, for\n",
      "instance, exactly: it is merely a beginning of what he shall suffer,\n",
      "though. And he’ll never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness\n",
      "and ignorance. I’ve got him faster than his scoundrel of a father\n",
      "secured me, and lower; for he takes a pride in his brutishness. I’ve\n",
      "taught him to scorn everything extra-animal as silly and weak. Don’t\n",
      "you think Hindley would be proud of his son, if he could see him?\n",
      "almost as proud as I am of mine. But there’s this difference; one is\n",
      "gold put to the use of paving-stones, and the other is tin polished to\n",
      "ape a service of silver. _Mine_ has nothing valuable about it; yet I\n",
      "shall have the merit of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go.\n",
      "_His_ had first-rate qualities, and they are lost: rendered worse than\n",
      "unavailing. _I_ have nothing to regret; _he_ would have more than any,\n",
      "but I, are aware of. And the best of it is, Hareton is damnably fond of\n",
      "me! You’ll own that I’ve outmatched Hindley there. If the dead villain\n",
      "could rise from his grave to abuse me for his offspring’s wrongs, I\n",
      "should have the fun of seeing the said offspring fight him back again,\n",
      "indignant that he should dare to rail at the one friend he has in the\n",
      "world!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Heathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea. I made no reply,\n",
      "because I saw that he expected none. Meantime, our young companion, who\n",
      "sat too removed from us to hear what was said, began to evince symptoms\n",
      "of uneasiness, probably repenting that he had denied himself the treat\n",
      "of Catherine’s society for fear of a little fatigue. His father\n",
      "remarked the restless glances wandering to the window, and the hand\n",
      "irresolutely extended towards his cap.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Get up, you idle boy!” he exclaimed, with assumed heartiness. “Away\n",
      "after them! they are just at the corner, by the stand of hives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Linton gathered his energies, and left the hearth. The lattice was\n",
      "open, and, as he stepped out, I heard Cathy inquiring of her unsociable\n",
      "attendant what was that inscription over the door? Hareton stared up,\n",
      "and scratched his head like a true clown.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s some damnable writing,” he answered. “I cannot read it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can’t read it?” cried Catherine; “I can read it: it’s English. But I\n",
      "want to know why it is there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Linton giggled: the first appearance of mirth he had exhibited.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He does not know his letters,” he said to his cousin. “Could you\n",
      "believe in the existence of such a colossal dunce?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he all as he should be?” asked Miss Cathy, seriously; “or is he\n",
      "simple: not right? I’ve questioned him twice now, and each time he\n",
      "looked so stupid I think he does not understand me. I can hardly\n",
      "understand _him_, I’m sure!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Linton repeated his laugh, and glanced at Hareton tauntingly; who\n",
      "certainly did not seem quite clear of comprehension at that moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s nothing the matter but laziness; is there, Earnshaw?” he said.\n",
      "“My cousin fancies you are an idiot. There you experience the\n",
      "consequence of scorning ‘book-larning,’ as you would say. Have you\n",
      "noticed, Catherine, his frightful Yorkshire pronunciation?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, where the devil is the use on’t?” growled Hareton, more ready in\n",
      "answering his daily companion. He was about to enlarge further, but the\n",
      "two youngsters broke into a noisy fit of merriment: my giddy miss being\n",
      "delighted to discover that she might turn his strange talk to matter of\n",
      "amusement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?” tittered Linton.\n",
      "“Papa told you not to say any bad words, and you can’t open your mouth\n",
      "without one. Do try to behave like a gentleman, now do!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If thou weren’t more a lass than a lad, I’d fell thee this minute, I\n",
      "would; pitiful lath of a crater!” retorted the angry boor, retreating,\n",
      "while his face burnt with mingled rage and mortification; for he was\n",
      "conscious of being insulted, and embarrassed how to resent it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Heathcliff having overheard the conversation, as well as I, smiled\n",
      "when he saw him go; but immediately afterwards cast a look of singular\n",
      "aversion on the flippant pair, who remained chattering in the doorway:\n",
      "the boy finding animation enough while discussing Hareton’s faults and\n",
      "deficiencies, and relating anecdotes of his goings on; and the girl\n",
      "relishing his pert and spiteful sayings, without considering the\n",
      "ill-nature they evinced. I began to dislike, more than to compassionate\n",
      "Linton, and to excuse his father in some measure for holding him cheap.\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed till afternoon: I could not tear Miss Cathy away sooner; but\n",
      "happily my master had not quitted his apartment, and remained ignorant\n",
      "of our prolonged absence. As we walked home, I would fain have\n",
      "enlightened my charge on the characters of the people we had quitted:\n",
      "but she got it into her head that I was prejudiced against them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aha!” she cried, “you take papa’s side, Ellen: you are partial I know;\n",
      "or else you wouldn’t have cheated me so many years into the notion that\n",
      "Linton lived a long way from here. I’m really extremely angry; only I’m\n",
      "so pleased I can’t show it! But you must hold your tongue about my\n",
      "uncle; he’s _my_ uncle, remember; and I’ll scold papa for quarrelling\n",
      "with him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so she ran on, till I relinquished the endeavour to convince her of\n",
      "her mistake. She did not mention the visit that night, because she did\n",
      "not see Mr. Linton. Next day it all came out, sadly to my chagrin; and\n",
      "still I was not altogether sorry: I thought the burden of directing and\n",
      "warning would be more efficiently borne by him than me. But he was too\n",
      "timid in giving satisfactory reasons for his wish that she should shun\n",
      "connection with the household of the Heights, and Catherine liked good\n",
      "reasons for every restraint that harassed her petted will.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Papa!” she exclaimed, after the morning’s salutations, “guess whom I\n",
      "saw yesterday, in my walk on the moors. Ah, papa, you started! you’ve\n",
      "not done right, have you, now? I saw—but listen, and you shall hear how\n",
      "I found you out; and Ellen, who is in league with you, and yet\n",
      "pretended to pity me so, when I kept hoping, and was always\n",
      "disappointed about Linton’s coming back!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave a faithful account of her excursion and its consequences; and\n",
      "my master, though he cast more than one reproachful look at me, said\n",
      "nothing till she had concluded. Then he drew her to him, and asked if\n",
      "she knew why he had concealed Linton’s near neighbourhood from her?\n",
      "Could she think it was to deny her a pleasure that she might harmlessly\n",
      "enjoy?\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was because you disliked Mr. Heathcliff,” she answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you believe I care more for my own feelings than yours, Cathy?”\n",
      "he said. “No, it was not because I disliked Mr. Heathcliff, but because\n",
      "Mr. Heathcliff dislikes me; and is a most diabolical man, delighting to\n",
      "wrong and ruin those he hates, if they give him the slightest\n",
      "opportunity. I knew that you could not keep up an acquaintance with\n",
      "your cousin without being brought into contact with him; and I knew he\n",
      "would detest you on my account; so for your own good, and nothing else,\n",
      "I took precautions that you should not see Linton again. I meant to\n",
      "explain this some time as you grew older, and I’m sorry I delayed it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But Mr. Heathcliff was quite cordial, papa,” observed Catherine, not\n",
      "at all convinced; “and _he_ didn’t object to our seeing each other: he\n",
      "said I might come to his house when I pleased; only I must not tell\n",
      "you, because you had quarrelled with him, and would not forgive him for\n",
      "marrying aunt Isabella. And you won’t. _You_ are the one to be blamed:\n",
      "he is willing to let _us_ be friends, at least; Linton and I; and you\n",
      "are not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My master, perceiving that she would not take his word for her\n",
      "uncle-in-law’s evil disposition, gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to\n",
      "Isabella, and the manner in which Wuthering Heights became his\n",
      "property. He could not bear to discourse long upon the topic; for\n",
      "though he spoke little of it, he still felt the same horror and\n",
      "detestation of his ancient enemy that had occupied his heart ever since\n",
      "Mrs. Linton’s death. “She might have been living yet, if it had not\n",
      "been for him!” was his constant bitter reflection; and, in his eyes,\n",
      "Heathcliff seemed a murderer. Miss Cathy—conversant with no bad deeds\n",
      "except her own slight acts of disobedience, injustice, and passion,\n",
      "arising from hot temper and thoughtlessness, and repented of on the day\n",
      "they were committed—was amazed at the blackness of spirit that could\n",
      "brood on and cover revenge for years, and deliberately prosecute its\n",
      "plans without a visitation of remorse. She appeared so deeply impressed\n",
      "and shocked at this new view of human nature—excluded from all her\n",
      "studies and all her ideas till now—that Mr. Edgar deemed it unnecessary\n",
      "to pursue the subject. He merely added: “You will know hereafter,\n",
      "darling, why I wish you to avoid his house and family; now return to\n",
      "your old employments and amusements, and think no more about them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Catherine kissed her father, and sat down quietly to her lessons for a\n",
      "couple of hours, according to custom; then she accompanied him into the\n",
      "grounds, and the whole day passed as usual: but in the evening, when\n",
      "she had retired to her room, and I went to help her to undress, I found\n",
      "her crying, on her knees by the bedside.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, fie, silly child!” I exclaimed. “If you had any real griefs you’d\n",
      "be ashamed to waste a tear on this little contrariety. You never had\n",
      "one shadow of substantial sorrow, Miss Catherine. Suppose, for a\n",
      "minute, that master and I were dead, and you were by yourself in the\n",
      "world: how would you feel, then? Compare the present occasion with such\n",
      "an affliction as that, and be thankful for the friends you have,\n",
      "instead of coveting more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m not crying for myself, Ellen,” she answered, “it’s for him. He\n",
      "expected to see me again to-morrow, and there he’ll be so disappointed:\n",
      "and he’ll wait for me, and I sha’n’t come!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nonsense!” said I, “do you imagine he has thought as much of you as\n",
      "you have of him? Hasn’t he Hareton for a companion? Not one in a\n",
      "hundred would weep at losing a relation they had just seen twice, for\n",
      "two afternoons. Linton will conjecture how it is, and trouble himself\n",
      "no further about you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot come?” she asked,\n",
      "rising to her feet. “And just send those books I promised to lend him?\n",
      "His books are not as nice as mine, and he wanted to have them\n",
      "extremely, when I told him how interesting they were. May I not,\n",
      "Ellen?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, indeed! no, indeed!” replied I with decision. “Then he would write\n",
      "to you, and there’d never be an end of it. No, Miss Catherine, the\n",
      "acquaintance must be dropped entirely: so papa expects, and I shall see\n",
      "that it is done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But how can one little note—?” she recommenced, putting on an\n",
      "imploring countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Silence!” I interrupted. “We’ll not begin with your little notes. Get\n",
      "into bed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She threw at me a very naughty look, so naughty that I would not kiss\n",
      "her good-night at first: I covered her up, and shut her door, in great\n",
      "displeasure; but, repenting half-way, I returned softly, and lo! there\n",
      "was Miss standing at the table with a bit of blank paper before her and\n",
      "a pencil in her hand, which she guiltily slipped out of sight on my\n",
      "entrance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll get nobody to take that, Catherine,” I said, “if you write it;\n",
      "and at present I shall put out your candle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I set the extinguisher on the flame, receiving as I did so a slap on my\n",
      "hand and a petulant “cross thing!” I then quitted her again, and she\n",
      "drew the bolt in one of her worst, most peevish humours. The letter was\n",
      "finished and forwarded to its destination by a milk-fetcher who came\n",
      "from the village; but that I didn’t learn till some time afterwards.\n",
      "Weeks passed on, and Cathy recovered her temper; though she grew\n",
      "wondrous fond of stealing off to corners by herself; and often, if I\n",
      "came near her suddenly while reading, she would start and bend over the\n",
      "book, evidently desirous to hide it; and I detected edges of loose\n",
      "paper sticking out beyond the leaves. She also got a trick of coming\n",
      "down early in the morning and lingering about the kitchen, as if she\n",
      "were expecting the arrival of something; and she had a small drawer in\n",
      "a cabinet in the library, which she would trifle over for hours, and\n",
      "whose key she took special care to remove when she left it.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, as she inspected this drawer, I observed that the playthings\n",
      "and trinkets which recently formed its contents were transmuted into\n",
      "bits of folded paper. My curiosity and suspicions were roused; I\n",
      "determined to take a peep at her mysterious treasures; so, at night, as\n",
      "soon as she and my master were safe upstairs, I searched, and readily\n",
      "found among my house keys one that would fit the lock. Having opened, I\n",
      "emptied the whole contents into my apron, and took them with me to\n",
      "examine at leisure in my own chamber. Though I could not but suspect, I\n",
      "was still surprised to discover that they were a mass of\n",
      "correspondence—daily almost, it must have been—from Linton Heathcliff:\n",
      "answers to documents forwarded by her. The earlier dated were\n",
      "embarrassed and short; gradually, however, they expanded into copious\n",
      "love-letters, foolish, as the age of the writer rendered natural, yet\n",
      "with touches here and there which I thought were borrowed from a more\n",
      "experienced source. Some of them struck me as singularly odd compounds\n",
      "of ardour and flatness; commencing in strong feeling, and concluding in\n",
      "the affected, wordy style that a schoolboy might use to a fancied,\n",
      "incorporeal sweetheart. Whether they satisfied Cathy I don’t know; but\n",
      "they appeared very worthless trash to me. After turning over as many as\n",
      "I thought proper, I tied them in a handkerchief and set them aside,\n",
      "relocking the vacant drawer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following her habit, my young lady descended early, and visited the\n",
      "kitchen: I watched her go to the door, on the arrival of a certain\n",
      "little boy; and, while the dairymaid filled his can, she tucked\n",
      "something into his jacket pocket, and plucked something out. I went\n",
      "round by the garden, and laid wait for the messenger; who fought\n",
      "valorously to defend his trust, and we spilt the milk between us; but I\n",
      "succeeded in abstracting the epistle; and, threatening serious\n",
      "consequences if he did not look sharp home, I remained under the wall\n",
      "and perused Miss Cathy’s affectionate composition. It was more simple\n",
      "and more eloquent than her cousin’s: very pretty and very silly. I\n",
      "shook my head, and went meditating into the house. The day being wet,\n",
      "she could not divert herself with rambling about the park; so, at the\n",
      "conclusion of her morning studies, she resorted to the solace of the\n",
      "drawer. Her father sat reading at the table; and I, on purpose, had\n",
      "sought a bit of work in some unripped fringes of the window-curtain,\n",
      "keeping my eye steadily fixed on her proceedings. Never did any bird\n",
      "flying back to a plundered nest, which it had left brimful of chirping\n",
      "young ones, express more complete despair, in its anguished cries and\n",
      "flutterings, than she by her single “Oh!” and the change that\n",
      "transfigured her late happy countenance. Mr. Linton looked up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is the matter, love? Have you hurt yourself?” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "His tone and look assured her _he_ had not been the discoverer of the\n",
      "hoard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, papa!” she gasped. “Ellen! Ellen! come upstairs—I’m sick!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I obeyed her summons, and accompanied her out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Ellen! you have got them,” she commenced immediately, dropping on\n",
      "her knees, when we were enclosed alone. “Oh, give them to me, and I’ll\n",
      "never, never do so again! Don’t tell papa. You have not told papa,\n",
      "Ellen? say you have not? I’ve been exceedingly naughty, but I won’t do\n",
      "it any more!”\n",
      "\n",
      "With a grave severity in my manner I bade her stand up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So,” I exclaimed, “Miss Catherine, you are tolerably far on, it seems:\n",
      "you may well be ashamed of them! A fine bundle of trash you study in\n",
      "your leisure hours, to be sure: why, it’s good enough to be printed!\n",
      "And what do you suppose the master will think when I display it before\n",
      "him? I hav’n’t shown it yet, but you needn’t imagine I shall keep your\n",
      "ridiculous secrets. For shame! and you must have led the way in writing\n",
      "such absurdities: he would not have thought of beginning, I’m certain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t! I didn’t!” sobbed Cathy, fit to break her heart. “I didn’t\n",
      "once think of loving him till—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Loving_!” cried I, as scornfully as I could utter the word.\n",
      "“_Loving_! Did anybody ever hear the like! I might just as well talk of\n",
      "loving the miller who comes once a year to buy our corn. Pretty loving,\n",
      "indeed! and both times together you have seen Linton hardly four hours\n",
      "in your life! Now here is the babyish trash. I’m going with it to the\n",
      "library; and we’ll see what your father says to such _loving_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She sprang at her precious epistles, but I held them above my head; and\n",
      "then she poured out further frantic entreaties that I would burn\n",
      "them—do anything rather than show them. And being really fully as much\n",
      "inclined to laugh as scold—for I esteemed it all girlish vanity—I at\n",
      "length relented in a measure, and asked,—“If I consent to burn them,\n",
      "will you promise faithfully neither to send nor receive a letter again,\n",
      "nor a book (for I perceive you have sent him books), nor locks of hair,\n",
      "nor rings, nor playthings?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don’t send playthings,” cried Catherine, her pride overcoming her\n",
      "shame.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor anything at all, then, my lady?” I said. “Unless you will, here I\n",
      "go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I promise, Ellen!” she cried, catching my dress. “Oh, put them in the\n",
      "fire, do, do!”\n",
      "\n",
      "But when I proceeded to open a place with the poker the sacrifice was\n",
      "too painful to be borne. She earnestly supplicated that I would spare\n",
      "her one or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One or two, Ellen, to keep for Linton’s sake!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I unknotted the handkerchief, and commenced dropping them in from an\n",
      "angle, and the flame curled up the chimney.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will have one, you cruel wretch!” she screamed, darting her hand\n",
      "into the fire, and drawing forth some half-consumed fragments, at the\n",
      "expense of her fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well—and I will have some to exhibit to papa!” I answered,\n",
      "shaking back the rest into the bundle, and turning anew to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "She emptied her blackened pieces into the flames, and motioned me to\n",
      "finish the immolation. It was done; I stirred up the ashes, and\n",
      "interred them under a shovelful of coals; and she mutely, and with a\n",
      "sense of intense injury, retired to her private apartment. I descended\n",
      "to tell my master that the young lady’s qualm of sickness was almost\n",
      "gone, but I judged it best for her to lie down a while. She wouldn’t\n",
      "dine; but she reappeared at tea, pale, and red about the eyes, and\n",
      "marvellously subdued in outward aspect. Next morning I answered the\n",
      "letter by a slip of paper, inscribed, “Master Heathcliff is requested\n",
      "to send no more notes to Miss Linton, as she will not receive them.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Summer drew to an end, and early autumn: it was past Michaelmas, but\n",
      "the harvest was late that year, and a few of our fields were still\n",
      "uncleared. Mr. Linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among\n",
      "the reapers; at the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk,\n",
      "and the evening happening to be chill and damp, my master caught a bad\n",
      "cold, that settled obstinately on his lungs, and confined him indoors\n",
      "throughout the whole of the winter, nearly without intermission.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Cathy, frightened from her little romance, had been considerably\n",
      "sadder and duller since its abandonment; and her father insisted on her\n",
      "reading less, and taking more exercise. She had his companionship no\n",
      "longer; I esteemed it a duty to supply its lack, as much as possible,\n",
      "with mine: an inefficient substitute; for I could only spare two or\n",
      "three hours, from my numerous diurnal occupations, to follow her\n",
      "footsteps, and then my society was obviously less desirable than his.\n",
      "\n",
      "On an afternoon in October, or the beginning of November—a fresh watery\n",
      "afternoon, when the turf and paths were rustling with moist, withered\n",
      "leaves, and the cold blue sky was half hidden by clouds—dark grey\n",
      "streamers, rapidly mounting from the west, and boding abundant rain—I\n",
      "requested my young lady to forego her ramble, because I was certain of\n",
      "showers. She refused; and I unwillingly donned a cloak, and took my\n",
      "umbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of the park: a\n",
      "formal walk which she generally affected if low-spirited—and that she\n",
      "invariably was when Mr. Edgar had been worse than ordinary, a thing\n",
      "never known from his confession, but guessed both by her and me from\n",
      "his increased silence and the melancholy of his countenance. She went\n",
      "sadly on: there was no running or bounding now, though the chill wind\n",
      "might well have tempted her to race. And often, from the side of my\n",
      "eye, I could detect her raising a hand, and brushing something off her\n",
      "cheek. I gazed round for a means of diverting her thoughts. On one side\n",
      "of the road rose a high, rough bank, where hazels and stunted oaks,\n",
      "with their roots half exposed, held uncertain tenure: the soil was too\n",
      "loose for the latter; and strong winds had blown some nearly\n",
      "horizontal. In summer Miss Catherine delighted to climb along these\n",
      "trunks, and sit in the branches, swinging twenty feet above the ground;\n",
      "and I, pleased with her agility and her light, childish heart, still\n",
      "considered it proper to scold every time I caught her at such an\n",
      "elevation, but so that she knew there was no necessity for descending.\n",
      "From dinner to tea she would lie in her breeze-rocked cradle, doing\n",
      "nothing except singing old songs—my nursery lore—to herself, or\n",
      "watching the birds, joint tenants, feed and entice their young ones to\n",
      "fly: or nestling with closed lids, half thinking, half dreaming,\n",
      "happier than words can express.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look, Miss!” I exclaimed, pointing to a nook under the roots of one\n",
      "twisted tree. “Winter is not here yet. There’s a little flower up\n",
      "yonder, the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those\n",
      "turf steps in July with a lilac mist. Will you clamber up, and pluck it\n",
      "to show to papa?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Cathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom trembling in its earthy\n",
      "shelter, and replied, at length—“No, I’ll not touch it: but it looks\n",
      "melancholy, does it not, Ellen?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” I observed, “about as starved and sackless as you: your cheeks\n",
      "are bloodless; let us take hold of hands and run. You’re so low, I\n",
      "daresay I shall keep up with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” she repeated, and continued sauntering on, pausing at intervals\n",
      "to muse over a bit of moss, or a tuft of blanched grass, or a fungus\n",
      "spreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage; and, ever\n",
      "and anon, her hand was lifted to her averted face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Catherine, why are you crying, love?” I asked, approaching and putting\n",
      "my arm over her shoulder. “You mustn’t cry because papa has a cold; be\n",
      "thankful it is nothing worse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She now put no further restraint on her tears; her breath was stifled\n",
      "by sobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, it _will_ be something worse,” she said. “And what shall I do when\n",
      "papa and you leave me, and I am by myself? I can’t forget your words,\n",
      "Ellen; they are always in my ear. How life will be changed, how dreary\n",
      "the world will be, when papa and you are dead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“None can tell whether you won’t die before us,” I replied. “It’s wrong\n",
      "to anticipate evil. We’ll hope there are years and years to come before\n",
      "any of us go: master is young, and I am strong, and hardly forty-five.\n",
      "My mother lived till eighty, a canty dame to the last. And suppose Mr.\n",
      "Linton were spared till he saw sixty, that would be more years than you\n",
      "have counted, Miss. And would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity\n",
      "above twenty years beforehand?”\n",

      "“But Aunt Isabella was younger than papa,” she remarked, gazing up with\n",
      "timid hope to seek further consolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aunt Isabella had not you and me to nurse her,” I replied. “She wasn’t\n",
      "as happy as Master: she hadn’t as much to live for. All you need do, is\n",
      "to wait well on your father, and cheer him by letting him see you\n",
      "cheerful; and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject: mind that,\n",
      "Cathy! I’ll not disguise but you might kill him if you were wild and\n",
      "reckless, and cherished a foolish, fanciful affection for the son of a\n",
      "person who would be glad to have him in his grave; and allowed him to\n",
      "discover that you fretted over the separation he has judged it\n",
      "expedient to make.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I fret about nothing on earth except papa’s illness,” answered my\n",
      "companion. “I care for nothing in comparison with papa. And I’ll\n",
      "never—never—oh, never, while I have my senses, do an act or say a word\n",
      "to vex him. I love him better than myself, Ellen; and I know it by\n",
      "this: I pray every night that I may live after him; because I would\n",

      "uplands. My feet were thoroughly wetted; I was cross and low; exactly\n",
      "the humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things. We\n",
      "entered the farm-house by the kitchen way, to ascertain whether Mr.\n",

      "fire; a quart of ale on the table near him, bristling with large pieces\n",
      "of toasted oat-cake; and his black, short pipe in his mouth. Catherine\n",
      "ran to the hearth to warm herself. I asked if the master was in? My\n",
      "question remained so long unanswered, that I thought the old man had\n",
      "grown deaf, and repeated it louder.\n",

      "\n",
      "Vigorous puffs, and a resolute stare into the grate, declared he had no\n",

      "breath. Dear me! Papa said you would call,” continued he, after\n",
      "recovering a little from Catherine’s embrace; while she stood by\n",
      "looking very contrite. “Will you shut the door, if you please? you left\n",

      "the fire. It’s so cold!”\n",

      "I stirred up the cinders, and fetched a scuttleful myself. The invalid\n",

      "rather have talked to you. Now, I can neither bear to talk, nor\n",

      "appeared more tranquil, and said she was very kind.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yes, I am. It’s something new to hear a voice like yours!” he replied.\n",
      "“But I have been vexed, because you wouldn’t come. And papa swore it\n",

      "and said you despised me; and if he had been in my place, he would be\n",

      "\n",
      "“Not many,” answered Linton; “but he goes on to the moors frequently,\n",
      "since the shooting season commenced; and you might spend an hour or two\n",
      "with me in his absence. Do say you will. I think I should not be\n",
      "peevish with you: you’d not provoke me, and you’d always be ready to\n",
      "help me, wouldn’t you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Catherine, stroking his long soft hair, “if I could only\n",

      "\n",
      "“And then you would like me as well as your father?” observed he, more\n",
      "cheerfully. “But papa says you would love me better than him and all\n",
      "the world, if you were my wife; so I’d rather you were that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I should never love anybody better than papa,” she returned\n",
      "gravely. “And people hate their wives, sometimes; but not their sisters\n",
      "and brothers: and if you were the latter, you would live with us, and\n",
      "papa would be as fond of you as he is of me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Linton denied that people ever hated their wives; but Cathy affirmed\n",
      "they did, and, in her wisdom, instanced his own father’s aversion to\n",
      "her aunt. I endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue. I couldn’t\n",
      "succeed till everything she knew was out. Master Heathcliff, much\n",
      "irritated, asserted her relation was false.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yours is a wicked man,” retorted Catherine; “and you are very naughty\n",
      "to dare to repeat what he says. He must be wicked to have made Aunt\n",

      "“Oh!” exclaimed Catherine, too enraged to continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And she loved mine,” added he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You little liar! I hate you now!” she panted, and her face grew red\n",
      "with passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She did! she did!” sang Linton, sinking into the recess of his chair,\n",
      "and leaning back his head to enjoy the agitation of the other\n",
      "disputant, who stood behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush, Master Heathcliff!” I said; “that’s your father’s tale, too, I\n",

      "Catherine! she did, she did!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Cathy, beside herself, gave the chair a violent push, and caused him to\n",
      "fall against one arm. He was immediately seized by a suffocating cough\n",
      "that soon ended his triumph. It lasted so long that it frightened even\n",
      "me. As to his cousin, she wept with all her might, aghast at the\n",
      "mischief she had done: though she said nothing. I held him till the fit\n",
      "exhausted itself. Then he thrust me away, and leant his head down\n",
      "silently. Catherine quelled her lamentations also, took a seat\n",
      "opposite, and looked solemnly into the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you feel now, Master Heathcliff?” I inquired, after waiting ten\n",
      "minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish _she_ felt as I do,” he replied: “spiteful, cruel thing!\n",
      "Hareton never touches me: he never struck me in his life. And I was\n",
      "better to-day: and there—” his voice died in a whimper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ didn’t strike you!” muttered Cathy, chewing her lip to prevent\n",
      "another burst of emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sighed and moaned like one under great suffering, and kept it up for\n",
      "a quarter of an hour; on purpose to distress his cousin apparently, for\n",
      "whenever he caught a stifled sob from her he put renewed pain and\n",
      "pathos into the inflexions of his voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m sorry I hurt you, Linton,” she said at length, racked beyond\n",
      "endurance. “But _I_ couldn’t have been hurt by that little push, and I\n",
      "had no idea that you could, either: you’re not much, are you, Linton?\n",
      "Don’t let me go home thinking I’ve done you harm. Answer! speak to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t speak to you,” he murmured; “you’ve hurt me so that I shall\n",
      "lie awake all night choking with this cough. If you had it you’d know\n",
      "what it was; but _you’ll_ be comfortably asleep while I’m in agony, and\n",
      "nobody near me. I wonder how you would like to pass those fearful\n",
      "nights!” And he began to wail aloud, for very pity of himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights,” I said, “it\n",
      "won’t be Miss who spoils your ease: you’d be the same had she never\n",
      "come. However, she shall not disturb you again; and perhaps you’ll get\n",
      "quieter when we leave you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Must I go?” asked Catherine dolefully, bending over him. “Do you want\n",
      "me to go, Linton?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can’t alter what you’ve done,” he replied pettishly, shrinking\n",
      "from her, “unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a\n",
      "fever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then, I must go?” she repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let me alone, at least,” said he; “I can’t bear your talking.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She lingered, and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome\n",
      "while; but as he neither looked up nor spoke, she finally made a\n",
      "movement to the door, and I followed. We were recalled by a scream.\n",
      "Linton had slid from his seat on to the hearthstone, and lay writhing\n",
      "in the mere perverseness of an indulged plague of a child, determined\n",
      "to be as grievous and harassing as it can. I thoroughly gauged his\n",
      "disposition from his behaviour, and saw at once it would be folly to\n",
      "attempt humouring him. Not so my companion: she ran back in terror,\n",
      "knelt down, and cried, and soothed, and entreated, till he grew quiet\n",
      "from lack of breath: by no means from compunction at distressing her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall lift him on to the settle,” I said, “and he may roll about as\n",
      "he pleases: we can’t stop to watch him. I hope you are satisfied, Miss\n",
      "Cathy, that _you_ are not the person to benefit him; and that his\n",
      "condition of health is not occasioned by attachment to you. Now, then,\n",
      "there he is! Come away: as soon as he knows there is nobody by to care\n",
      "for his nonsense, he’ll be glad to lie still.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She placed a cushion under his head, and offered him some water; he\n",
      "rejected the latter, and tossed uneasily on the former, as if it were a\n",
      "stone or a block of wood. She tried to put it more comfortably.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t do with that,” he said; “it’s not high enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Catherine brought another to lay above it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s _too_ high,” murmured the provoking thing.\n",
      "\n",

      "He twined himself up to her, as she half knelt by the settle, and\n",
      "converted her shoulder into a support.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, that won’t do,” I said. “You’ll be content with the cushion,\n",
      "Master Heathcliff. Miss has wasted too much time on you already: we\n",
      "cannot remain five minutes longer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, yes, we can!” replied Cathy. “He’s good and patient now. He’s\n",
      "beginning to think I shall have far greater misery than he will\n",
      "to-night, if I believe he is the worse for my visit: and then I dare\n",
      "not come again. Tell the truth about it, Linton; for I mustn’t come, if\n",
      "I have hurt you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must come, to cure me,” he answered. “You ought to come, because\n",
      "you have hurt me: you know you have extremely! I was not as ill when\n",
      "you entered as I am at present—was I?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you’ve made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion.—I\n",
      "didn’t do it all,” said his cousin. “However, we’ll be friends now. And\n",
      "you want me: you would wish to see me sometimes, really?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I told you I did,” he replied impatiently. “Sit on the settle and let\n",
      "me lean on your knee. That’s as mamma used to do, whole afternoons\n",
      "together. Sit quite still and don’t talk: but you may sing a song, if\n",
      "you can sing; or you may say a nice long interesting ballad—one of\n",
      "those you promised to teach me; or a story. I’d rather have a ballad,\n",
      "though: begin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Catherine repeated the longest she could remember. The employment\n",
      "pleased both mightily. Linton would have another, and after that\n",
      "another, notwithstanding my strenuous objections; and so they went on\n",
      "until the clock struck twelve, and we heard Hareton in the court,\n",
      "returning for his dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And to-morrow, Catherine, will you be here to-morrow?” asked young\n",
      "Heathcliff, holding her frock as she rose reluctantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” I answered, “nor next day neither.” She, however, gave a\n",
      "different response evidently, for his forehead cleared as she stooped\n",
      "and whispered in his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You won’t go to-morrow, recollect, Miss!” I commenced, when we were\n",
      "out of the house. “You are not dreaming of it, are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I’ll take good care,” I continued: “I’ll have that lock mended,\n",
      "and you can escape by no way else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can get over the wall,” she said laughing. “The Grange is not a\n",
      "prison, Ellen, and you are not my gaoler. And besides, I’m almost\n",
      "seventeen: I’m a woman. And I’m certain Linton would recover quickly if\n",
      "he had me to look after him. I’m older than he is, you know, and wiser:\n",
      "less childish, am I not? And he’ll soon do as I direct him, with some\n",
      "slight coaxing. He’s a pretty little darling when he’s good. I’d make\n",
      "such a pet of him, if he were mine. We should never quarrel, should we,\n",
      "after we were used to each other? Don’t you like him, Ellen?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Like him!” I exclaimed. “The worst-tempered bit of a sickly slip that\n",
      "ever struggled into its teens. Happily, as Mr. Heathcliff conjectured,\n",
      "he’ll not win twenty. I doubt whether he’ll see spring, indeed. And\n",
      "small loss to his family whenever he drops off. And lucky it is for us\n",
      "that his father took him: the kinder he was treated, the more tedious\n",
      "and selfish he’d be. I’m glad you have no chance of having him for a\n",
      "husband, Miss Catherine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "My companion waxed serious at hearing this speech. To speak of his\n",
      "death so regardlessly wounded her feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s younger than I,” she answered, after a protracted pause of\n",
      "meditation, “and he ought to live the longest: he will—he must live as\n",
      "long as I do. He’s as strong now as when he first came into the north;\n",
      "I’m positive of that. It’s only a cold that ails him, the same as papa\n",
      "has. You say papa will get better, and why shouldn’t he?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well,” I cried, “after all, we needn’t trouble ourselves; for\n",
      "listen, Miss,—and mind, I’ll keep my word,—if you attempt going to\n",
      "Wuthering Heights again, with or without me, I shall inform Mr. Linton,\n",
      "and, unless he allow it, the intimacy with your cousin must not be\n",
      "revived.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It has been revived,” muttered Cathy, sulkily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Must not be continued, then,” I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ll see,” was her reply, and she set off at a gallop, leaving me to\n",
      "toil in the rear.\n",
      "\n",
      "We both reached home before our dinner-time; my master supposed we had\n",
      "been wandering through the park, and therefore he demanded no\n",
      "explanation of our absence. As soon as I entered I hastened to change\n",
      "my soaked shoes and stockings; but sitting such a while at the Heights\n",
      "had done the mischief. On the succeeding morning I was laid up, and\n",
      "during three weeks I remained incapacitated for attending to my duties:\n",
      "a calamity never experienced prior to that period, and never, I am\n",
      "thankful to say, since.\n",

      "My little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me, and\n",
      "cheer my solitude; the confinement brought me exceedingly low. It is\n",
      "wearisome, to a stirring active body: but few have slighter reasons for\n",
      "complaint than I had. The moment Catherine left Mr. Linton’s room she\n",
      "appeared at my bedside. Her day was divided between us; no amusement\n",
      "usurped a minute: she neglected her meals, her studies, and her play;\n",
      "and she was the fondest nurse that ever watched. She must have had a\n",
      "warm heart, when she loved her father so, to give so much to me. I said\n",
      "her days were divided between us; but the master retired early, and I\n",
      "generally needed nothing after six o’clock, thus the evening was her\n",
      "own. Poor thing! I never considered what she did with herself after\n",
      "tea. And though frequently, when she looked in to bid me good-night, I\n",
      "remarked a fresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender\n",
      "fingers, instead of fancying the hue borrowed from a cold ride across\n",
      "the moors, I laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library.\n",

      "\n",
      "At the close of three weeks I was able to quit my chamber and move\n",
      "about the house. And on the first occasion of my sitting up in the\n",
      "evening I asked Catherine to read to me, because my eyes were weak. We\n",
      "were in the library, the master having gone to bed: she consented,\n",
      "rather unwillingly, I fancied; and imagining my sort of books did not\n",
      "suit her, I bid her please herself in the choice of what she perused.\n",
      "She selected one of her own favourites, and got forward steadily about\n",
      "an hour; then came frequent questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ellen, are not you tired? Hadn’t you better lie down now? You’ll be\n",
      "sick, keeping up so long, Ellen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no, dear, I’m not tired,” I returned, continually.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perceiving me immovable, she essayed another method of showing her\n",
      "disrelish for her occupation. It changed to yawning, and stretching,\n",
      "and—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ellen, I’m tired.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give over then and talk,” I answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was worse: she fretted and sighed, and looked at her watch till\n",
      "eight, and finally went to her room, completely overdone with sleep;\n",
      "judging by her peevish, heavy look, and the constant rubbing she\n",
      "inflicted on her eyes. The following night she seemed more impatient\n",
      "still; and on the third from recovering my company she complained of a\n",
      "headache, and left me. I thought her conduct odd; and having remained\n",
      "alone a long while, I resolved on going and inquiring whether she were\n",
      "better, and asking her to come and lie on the sofa, instead of upstairs\n",
      "in the dark. No Catherine could I discover upstairs, and none below.\n",
      "The servants affirmed they had not seen her. I listened at Mr. Edgar’s\n",
      "door; all was silence. I returned to her apartment, extinguished my\n",
      "candle, and seated myself in the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moon shone bright; a sprinkling of snow covered the ground, and I\n",
      "reflected that she might, possibly, have taken it into her head to walk\n",
      "about the garden, for refreshment. I did detect a figure creeping along\n",
      "the inner fence of the park; but it was not my young mistress: on its\n",
      "emerging into the light, I recognised one of the grooms. He stood a\n",
      "considerable period, viewing the carriage-road through the grounds;\n",
      "then started off at a brisk pace, as if he had detected something, and\n",
      "reappeared presently, leading Miss’s pony; and there she was, just\n",
      "dismounted, and walking by its side. The man took his charge stealthily\n",
      "across the grass towards the stable. Cathy entered by the\n",
      "casement-window of the drawing-room, and glided noiselessly up to where\n",
      "I awaited her. She put the door gently to, slipped off her snowy\n",
      "shoes, untied her hat, and was proceeding, unconscious of my espionage,\n",
      "to lay aside her mantle, when I suddenly rose and revealed myself. The\n",
      "surprise petrified her an instant: she uttered an inarticulate\n",
      "exclamation, and stood fixed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Miss Catherine,” I began, too vividly impressed by her recent\n",
      "kindness to break into a scold, “where have you been riding out at this\n",
      "hour? And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale? Where\n",
      "have you been? Speak!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To the bottom of the park,” she stammered. “I didn’t tell a tale.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And nowhere else?” I demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” was the muttered reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Catherine!” I cried, sorrowfully. “You know you have been doing\n",
      "wrong, or you wouldn’t be driven to uttering an untruth to me. That\n",
      "does grieve me. I’d rather be three months ill, than hear you frame a\n",
      "deliberate lie.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She sprang forward, and bursting into tears, threw her arms round my\n",
      "neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Ellen, I’m so afraid of you being angry,” she said. “Promise not\n",
      "to be angry, and you shall know the very truth: I hate to hide it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We sat down in the window-seat; I assured her I would not scold,\n",
      "whatever her secret might be, and I guessed it, of course; so she\n",
      "commenced—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve been to Wuthering Heights, Ellen, and I’ve never missed going a\n",
      "day since you fell ill; except thrice before, and twice after you left\n",
      "your room. I gave Michael books and pictures to prepare Minny every\n",
      "evening, and to put her back in the stable: you mustn’t scold _him_\n",
      "either, mind. I was at the Heights by half-past six, and generally\n",
      "stayed till half-past eight, and then galloped home. It was not to\n",
      "amuse myself that I went: I was often wretched all the time. Now and\n",
      "then I was happy: once in a week perhaps. At first, I expected there\n",
      "would be sad work persuading you to let me keep my word to Linton: for\n",
      "I had engaged to call again next day, when we quitted him; but, as you\n",
      "stayed upstairs on the morrow, I escaped that trouble. While Michael\n",
      "was refastening the lock of the park door in the afternoon, I got\n",
      "possession of the key, and told him how my cousin wished me to visit\n",
      "him, because he was sick, and couldn’t come to the Grange; and how papa\n",
      "would object to my going: and then I negotiated with him about the\n",
      "pony. He is fond of reading, and he thinks of leaving soon to get\n",
      "married; so he offered, if I would lend him books out of the library,\n",
      "to do what I wished: but I preferred giving him my own, and that\n",
      "satisfied him better.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On my second visit Linton seemed in lively spirits; and Zillah (that\n",
      "is their housekeeper) made us a clean room and a good fire, and told us\n",
      "that, as Joseph was out at a prayer-meeting and Hareton Earnshaw was\n",
      "off with his dogs—robbing our woods of pheasants, as I heard\n",
      "afterwards—we might do what we liked. She brought me some warm wine and\n",
      "gingerbread, and appeared exceedingly good-natured; and Linton sat in\n",
      "the arm-chair, and I in the little rocking chair on the hearth-stone,\n",
      "and we laughed and talked so merrily, and found so much to say: we\n",
      "planned where we would go, and what we would do in summer. I needn’t\n",
      "repeat that, because you would call it silly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One time, however, we were near quarrelling. He said the pleasantest\n",
      "manner of spending a hot July day was lying from morning till evening\n",
      "on a bank of heath in the middle of the moors, with the bees humming\n",
      "dreamily about among the bloom, and the larks singing high up overhead,\n",
      "and the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly. That\n",
      "was his most perfect idea of heaven’s happiness: mine was rocking in a\n",
      "rustling green tree, with a west wind blowing, and bright white clouds\n",
      "flitting rapidly above; and not only larks, but throstles, and\n",
      "blackbirds, and linnets, and cuckoos pouring out music on every side,\n",
      "and the moors seen at a distance, broken into cool dusky dells; but\n",
      "close by great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze;\n",
      "and woods and sounding water, and the whole world awake and wild with\n",
      "joy. He wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace; I wanted all to\n",
      "sparkle and dance in a glorious jubilee. I said his heaven would be\n",
      "only half alive; and he said mine would be drunk: I said I should fall\n",
      "asleep in his; and he said he could not breathe in mine, and began to\n",
      "grow very snappish. At last, we agreed to try both, as soon as the\n",
      "right weather came; and then we kissed each other and were friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "“After sitting still an hour, I looked at the great room with its\n",
      "smooth uncarpeted floor, and thought how nice it would be to play in,\n",
      "if we removed the table; and I asked Linton to call Zillah in to help\n",
      "us, and we’d have a game at blindman’s-buff; she should try to catch\n",
      "us: you used to, you know, Ellen. He wouldn’t: there was no pleasure in\n",
      "it, he said; but he consented to play at ball with me. We found two in\n",
      "a cupboard, among a heap of old toys, tops, and hoops, and battledores\n",
      "and shuttlecocks. One was marked C., and the other H.; I wished to have\n",
      "the C., because that stood for Catherine, and the H. might be for\n",
      "Heathcliff, his name; but the bran came out of H., and Linton didn’t\n",
      "like it. I beat him constantly; and he got cross again, and coughed,\n",
      "and returned to his chair. That night, though, he easily recovered his\n",
      "good humour: he was charmed with two or three pretty songs—_your_\n",
      "songs, Ellen; and when I was obliged to go, he begged and entreated me\n",
      "to come the following evening; and I promised. Minny and I went flying\n",
      "home as light as air; and I dreamt of Wuthering Heights and my sweet,\n",
      "darling cousin, till morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the morrow I was sad; partly because you were poorly, and partly\n",
      "that I wished my father knew, and approved of my excursions: but it was\n",
      "beautiful moonlight after tea; and, as I rode on, the gloom cleared. I\n",
      "shall have another happy evening, I thought to myself; and what\n",
      "delights me more, my pretty Linton will. I trotted up their garden, and\n",
      "was turning round to the back, when that fellow Earnshaw met me, took\n",
      "my bridle, and bid me go in by the front entrance. He patted Minny’s\n",
      "neck, and said she was a bonny beast, and appeared as if he wanted me\n",
      "to speak to him. I only told him to leave my horse alone, or else it\n",
      "would kick him. He answered in his vulgar accent, ‘It wouldn’t do mitch\n",
      "hurt if it did;’ and surveyed its legs with a smile. I was half\n",
      "inclined to make it try; however, he moved off to open the door, and,\n",
      "as he raised the latch, he looked up to the inscription above, and\n",
      "said, with a stupid mixture of awkwardness and elation: ‘Miss\n",
      "Catherine! I can read yon, now.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Wonderful,’ I exclaimed. ‘Pray let us hear you—you _are_ grown\n",
      "clever!’\n",
      "\n",
      "“He spelt, and drawled over by syllables, the name—‘Hareton Earnshaw.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘And the figures?’ I cried, encouragingly, perceiving that he came to\n",
      "a dead halt.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘I cannot tell them yet,’ he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Oh, you dunce!’ I said, laughing heartily at his failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The fool stared, with a grin hovering about his lips, and a scowl\n",
      "gathering over his eyes, as if uncertain whether he might not join in\n",
      "my mirth: whether it were not pleasant familiarity, or what it really\n",
      "was, contempt. I settled his doubts, by suddenly retrieving my gravity\n",
      "and desiring him to walk away, for I came to see Linton, not him. He\n",
      "reddened—I saw that by the moonlight—dropped his hand from the latch,\n",
      "and skulked off, a picture of mortified vanity. He imagined himself to\n",
      "be as accomplished as Linton, I suppose, because he could spell his own\n",
      "name; and was marvellously discomfited that I didn’t think the same.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stop, Miss Catherine, dear!” I interrupted. “I shall not scold, but I\n",
      "don’t like your conduct there. If you had remembered that Hareton was\n",
      "your cousin as much as Master Heathcliff, you would have felt how\n",
      "improper it was to behave in that way. At least, it was praiseworthy\n",
      "ambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as Linton; and\n",
      "probably he did not learn merely to show off: you had made him ashamed\n",
      "of his ignorance before, I have no doubt; and he wished to remedy it\n",
      "and please you. To sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad\n",
      "breeding. Had _you_ been brought up in his circumstances, would you be\n",
      "less rude? He was as quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were;\n",
      "and I’m hurt that he should be despised now, because that base\n",
      "Heathcliff has treated him so unjustly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Ellen, you won’t cry about it, will you?” she exclaimed,\n",
      "surprised at my earnestness. “But wait, and you shall hear if he conned\n",
      "his A B C to please me; and if it were worth while being civil to the\n",
      "brute. I entered; Linton was lying on the settle, and half got up to\n",
      "welcome me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘I’m ill to-night, Catherine, love,’ he said; ‘and you must have all\n",
      "the talk, and let me listen. Come, and sit by me. I was sure you\n",
      "wouldn’t break your word, and I’ll make you promise again, before you\n",
      "go.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“I knew now that I mustn’t tease him, as he was ill; and I spoke softly\n",
      "and put no questions, and avoided irritating him in any way. I had\n",
      "brought some of my nicest books for him: he asked me to read a little\n",
      "of one, and I was about to comply, when Earnshaw burst the door open:\n",
      "having gathered venom with reflection. He advanced direct to us, seized\n",
      "Linton by the arm, and swung him off the seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Get to thy own room!’ he said, in a voice almost inarticulate with\n",

      "into the kitchen; and he clenched his fist as I followed, seemingly\n",
      "longing to knock me down. I was afraid for a moment, and I let one\n",

      "Park, and try mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Linton did not appear to remember what she talked of; and he had\n",
      "evidently great difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation. His\n",
      "lack of interest in the subjects she started, and his equal incapacity\n",
      "to contribute to her entertainment, were so obvious that she could not\n",
      "conceal her disappointment. An indefinite alteration had come over his\n",
      "whole person and manner. The pettishness that might be caressed into\n",
      "fondness, had yielded to a listless apathy; there was less of the\n",
      "peevish temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be\n",
      "soothed, and more of the self-absorbed moroseness of a confirmed\n",
      "invalid, repelling consolation, and ready to regard the good-humoured\n",
      "mirth of others as an insult. Catherine perceived, as well as I did,\n",
      "that he held it rather a punishment, than a gratification, to endure\n",
      "our company; and she made no scruple of proposing, presently, to\n",
      "depart. That proposal, unexpectedly, roused Linton from his lethargy,\n",
      "and threw him into a strange state of agitation. He glanced fearfully\n",
      "towards the Heights, begging she would remain another half-hour, at\n",
      "least.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I think,” said Cathy, “you’d be more comfortable at home than\n",
      "sitting here; and I cannot amuse you to-day, I see, by my tales, and\n",
      "songs, and chatter: you have grown wiser than I, in these six months;\n",
      "you have little taste for my diversions now: or else, if I could amuse\n",
      "you, I’d willingly stay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stay to rest yourself,” he replied. “And, Catherine, don’t think or\n",
      "say that I’m _very_ unwell: it is the heavy weather and heat that make\n",
      "me dull; and I walked about, before you came, a great deal for me. Tell\n",
      "uncle I’m in tolerable health, will you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell him that _you_ say so, Linton. I couldn’t affirm that you\n",
      "are,” observed my young lady, wondering at his pertinacious assertion\n",
      "of what was evidently an untruth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And be here again next Thursday,” continued he, shunning her puzzled\n",
      "gaze. “And give him my thanks for permitting you to come—my best\n",
      "thanks, Catherine. And—and, if you _did_ meet my father, and he asked\n",
      "you about me, don’t lead him to suppose that I’ve been extremely silent\n",
      "and stupid: don’t look sad and downcast, as you _are_ doing—he’ll be\n",
      "angry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I care nothing for his anger,” exclaimed Cathy, imagining she would be\n",
      "its object.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I do,” said her cousin, shuddering. “_Don’t_ provoke him against\n",
      "me, Catherine, for he is very hard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he severe to you, Master Heathcliff?” I inquired. “Has he grown\n",
      "weary of indulgence, and passed from passive to active hatred?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Linton looked at me, but did not answer; and, after keeping her seat by\n",
      "his side another ten minutes, during which his head fell drowsily on\n",
      "his breast, and he uttered nothing except suppressed moans of\n",
      "exhaustion or pain, Cathy began to seek solace in looking for\n",
      "bilberries, and sharing the produce of her researches with me: she did\n",
      "not offer them to him, for she saw further notice would only weary and\n",
      "annoy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it half-an-hour now, Ellen?” she whispered in my ear, at last. “I\n",
      "can’t tell why we should stay. He’s asleep, and papa will be wanting us\n",
      "back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, we must not leave him asleep,” I answered; “wait till he wakes,\n",
      "and be patient. You were mighty eager to set off, but your longing to\n",
      "see poor Linton has soon evaporated!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why did _he_ wish to see me?” returned Catherine. “In his crossest\n",
      "humours, formerly, I liked him better than I do in his present curious\n",
      "mood. It’s just as if it were a task he was compelled to perform—this\n",
      "interview—for fear his father should scold him. But I’m hardly going to\n",
      "come to give Mr. Heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason he may have for\n",
      "ordering Linton to undergo this penance. And, though I’m glad he’s\n",
      "better in health, I’m sorry he’s so much less pleasant, and so much\n",
      "less affectionate to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You think _he is_ better in health, then?” I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” she answered; “because he always made such a great deal of his\n",
      "sufferings, you know. He is not tolerably well, as he told me to tell\n",
      "papa; but he’s better, very likely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There you differ with me, Miss Cathy,” I remarked; “I should\n",
      "conjecture him to be far worse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Linton here started from his slumber in bewildered terror, and asked if\n",
      "any one had called his name.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Catherine; “unless in dreams. I cannot conceive how you\n",
      "manage to doze out of doors, in the morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought I heard my father,” he gasped, glancing up to the frowning\n",
      "nab above us. “You are sure nobody spoke?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite sure,” replied his cousin. “Only Ellen and I were disputing\n",
      "concerning your health. Are you truly stronger, Linton, than when we\n",
      "separated in winter? If you be, I’m certain one thing is not\n",
      "stronger—your regard for me: speak,—are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The tears gushed from Linton’s eyes as he answered, “Yes, yes, I am!”\n",
      "And, still under the spell of the imaginary voice, his gaze wandered up\n",
      "and down to detect its owner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cathy rose. “For to-day we must part,” she said. “And I won’t conceal\n",
      "that I have been sadly disappointed with our meeting; though I’ll\n",
      "mention it to nobody but you: not that I stand in awe of Mr.\n",
      "Heathcliff.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush,” murmured Linton; “for God’s sake, hush! He’s coming.” And he\n",
      "clung to Catherine’s arm, striving to detain her; but at that\n",
      "announcement she hastily disengaged herself, and whistled to Minny, who\n",
      "obeyed her like a dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll be here next Thursday,” she cried, springing to the saddle.\n",
      "“Good-bye. Quick, Ellen!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so we left him, scarcely conscious of our departure, so absorbed\n",
      "was he in anticipating his father’s approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we reached home, Catherine’s displeasure softened into a\n",
      "perplexed sensation of pity and regret, largely blended with vague,\n",
      "uneasy doubts about Linton’s actual circumstances, physical and social:\n",
      "in which I partook, though I counselled her not to say much; for a\n",
      "second journey would make us better judges. My master requested an\n",
      "account of our ongoings. His nephew’s offering of thanks was duly\n",
      "delivered, Miss Cathy gently touching on the rest: I also threw little\n",
      "light on his inquiries, for I hardly knew what to hide and what to\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven days glided away, every one marking its course by the henceforth\n",
      "rapid alteration of Edgar Linton’s state. The havoc that months had\n",
      "previously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours. Catherine\n",
      "we would fain have deluded yet; but her own quick spirit refused to\n",
      "delude her: it divined in secret, and brooded on the dreadful\n",
      "probability, gradually ripening into certainty. She had not the heart\n",
      "to mention her ride, when Thursday came round; I mentioned it for her,\n",
      "and obtained permission to order her out of doors: for the library,\n",
      "where her father stopped a short time daily—the brief period he could\n",
      "bear to sit up—and his chamber, had become her whole world. She grudged\n",
      "each moment that did not find her bending over his pillow, or seated by\n",
      "his side. Her countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow, and my\n",
      "master gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a\n",
      "happy change of scene and society; drawing comfort from the hope that\n",
      "she would not now be left entirely alone after his death.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a fixed idea, I guessed by several observations he let fall,\n",
      "that, as his nephew resembled him in person, he would resemble him in\n",
      "mind; for Linton’s letters bore few or no indications of his defective\n",
      "character. And I, through pardonable weakness, refrained from\n",
      "correcting the error; asking myself what good there would be in\n",
      "disturbing his last moments with information that he had neither power\n",
      "nor opportunity to turn to account.\n",
      "\n",
      "We deferred our excursion till the afternoon; a golden afternoon of\n",
      "August: every breath from the hills so full of life, that it seemed\n",
      "whoever respired it, though dying, might revive. Catherine’s face was\n",
      "just like the landscape—shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid\n",
      "succession; but the shadows rested longer, and the sunshine was more\n",
      "transient; and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that\n",
      "passing forgetfulness of its cares.\n",
      "\n",
      "We discerned Linton watching at the same spot he had selected before.\n",
      "My young mistress alighted, and told me that, as she was resolved to\n",
      "stay a very little while, I had better hold the pony and remain on\n",
      "horseback; but I dissented: I wouldn’t risk losing sight of the charge\n",
      "committed to me a minute; so we climbed the slope of heath together.\n",
      "Master Heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion:\n",
      "not the animation of high spirits though, nor yet of joy; it looked\n",
      "more like fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is late!” he said, speaking short and with difficulty. “Is not your\n",
      "father very ill? I thought you wouldn’t come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Why_ won’t you be candid?” cried Catherine, swallowing her greeting.\n",
      "“Why cannot you say at once you don’t want me? It is strange, Linton,\n",
      "that for the second time you have brought me here on purpose,\n",
      "apparently to distress us both, and for no reason besides!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Linton shivered, and glanced at her, half supplicating, half ashamed;\n",
      "but his cousin’s patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical\n",
      "behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My father _is_ very ill,” she said; “and why am I called from his\n",
      "bedside? Why didn’t you send to absolve me from my promise, when you\n",
      "wished I wouldn’t keep it? Come! I desire an explanation: playing and\n",
      "trifling are completely banished out of my mind; and I can’t dance\n",
      "attendance on your affectations now!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My affectations!” he murmured; “what are they? For heaven’s sake,\n",
      "Catherine, don’t look so angry! Despise me as much as you please; I am\n",
      "a worthless, cowardly wretch: I can’t be scorned enough; but I’m too\n",
      "mean for your anger. Hate my father, and spare me for contempt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nonsense!” cried Catherine in a passion. “Foolish, silly boy! And\n",
      "there! he trembles, as if I were really going to touch him! You needn’t\n",
      "bespeak contempt, Linton: anybody will have it spontaneously at your\n",
      "service. Get off! I shall return home: it is folly dragging you from\n",
      "the hearth-stone, and pretending—what do we pretend? Let go my frock!\n",
      "If I pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened, you should\n",
      "spurn such pity. Ellen, tell him how disgraceful this conduct is. Rise,\n",
      "and don’t degrade yourself into an abject reptile—_don’t_!”\n",
      "\n",
      "With streaming face and an expression of agony, Linton had thrown his\n",
      "nerveless frame along the ground: he seemed convulsed with exquisite\n",
      "terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” he sobbed, “I cannot bear it! Catherine, Catherine, I’m a\n",
      "traitor, too, and I dare not tell you! But leave me, and I shall be\n",
      "killed! _Dear_ Catherine, my life is in your hands: and you have said\n",
      "you loved me, and if you did, it wouldn’t harm you. You’ll not go,\n",
      "then? kind, sweet, good Catherine! And perhaps you _will_ consent—and\n",
      "he’ll let me die with you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "My young lady, on witnessing his intense anguish, stooped to raise him.\n",
      "The old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation, and she\n",
      "grew thoroughly moved and alarmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Consent to what?” she asked. “To stay! tell me the meaning of this\n",
      "strange talk, and I will. You contradict your own words, and distract\n",
      "me! Be calm and frank, and confess at once all that weighs on your\n",
      "heart. You wouldn’t injure me, Linton, would you? You wouldn’t let any\n",
      "enemy hurt me, if you could prevent it? I’ll believe you are a coward,\n",
      "for yourself, but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But my father threatened me,” gasped the boy, clasping his attenuated\n",
      "fingers, “and I dread him—I dread him! I _dare_ not tell!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, well!” said Catherine, with scornful compassion, “keep your\n",
      "secret: _I’m_ no coward. Save yourself: I’m not afraid!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her magnanimity provoked his tears: he wept wildly, kissing her\n",
      "supporting hands, and yet could not summon courage to speak out. I was\n",
      "cogitating what the mystery might be, and determined Catherine should\n",
      "never suffer to benefit him or any one else, by my good will; when,\n",
      "hearing a rustle among the ling, I looked up and saw Mr. Heathcliff\n",
      "almost close upon us, descending the Heights. He didn’t cast a glance\n",
      "towards my companions, though they were sufficiently near for Linton’s\n",
      "sobs to be audible; but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed\n",
      "to none besides, and the sincerity of which I couldn’t avoid doubting,\n",
      "he said—\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is something to see you so near to my house, Nelly. How are you at\n",
      "the Grange? Let us hear. The rumour goes,” he added, in a lower tone,\n",
      "“that Edgar Linton is on his death-bed: perhaps they exaggerate his\n",
      "illness?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; my master is dying,” I replied: “it is true enough. A sad thing it\n",
      "will be for us all, but a blessing for him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How long will he last, do you think?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know,” I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because,” he continued, looking at the two young people, who were\n",
      "fixed under his eye—Linton appeared as if he could not venture to stir\n",
      "or raise his head, and Catherine could not move, on his\n",
      "account—“because that lad yonder seems determined to beat me; and I’d\n",
      "thank his uncle to be quick, and go before him! Hallo! has the whelp\n",
      "been playing that game long? I _did_ give him some lessons about\n",
      "snivelling. Is he pretty lively with Miss Linton generally?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lively? no—he has shown the greatest distress,” I answered. “To see\n",
      "him, I should say, that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the\n",
      "hills, he ought to be in bed, under the hands of a doctor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He shall be, in a day or two,” muttered Heathcliff. “But first—get up,\n",
      "Linton! Get up!” he shouted. “Don’t grovel on the ground there: up,\n",
      "this moment!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear,\n",
      "caused by his father’s glance towards him, I suppose: there was nothing\n",
      "else to produce such humiliation. He made several efforts to obey, but\n",
      "his little strength was annihilated for the time, and he fell back\n",
      "again with a moan. Mr. Heathcliff advanced, and lifted him to lean\n",
      "against a ridge of turf.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” said he, with curbed ferocity, “I’m getting angry—and if you\n",
      "don’t command that paltry spirit of yours—_damn_ you! get up directly!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will, father,” he panted. “Only, let me alone, or I shall faint.\n",
      "I’ve done as you wished, I’m sure. Catherine will tell you that I—that\n",
      "I—have been cheerful. Ah! keep by me, Catherine; give me your hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take mine,” said his father; “stand on your feet. There now—she’ll\n",
      "lend you her arm: that’s right, look at _her_. You would imagine I was\n",
      "the devil himself, Miss Linton, to excite such horror. Be so kind as to\n",
      "walk home with him, will you? He shudders if I touch him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Linton dear!” whispered Catherine, “I can’t go to Wuthering Heights:\n",
      "papa has forbidden me. He’ll not harm you: why are you so afraid?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can never re-enter that house,” he answered. “I’m _not_ to re-enter\n",
      "it without you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stop!” cried his father. “We’ll respect Catherine’s filial scruples.\n",
      "Nelly, take him in, and I’ll follow your advice concerning the doctor,\n",
      "without delay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll do well,” replied I. “But I must remain with my mistress: to\n",
      "mind your son is not my business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are very stiff,” said Heathcliff, “I know that: but you’ll force\n",
      "me to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity.\n",
      "Come, then, my hero. Are you willing to return, escorted by me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He approached once more, and made as if he would seize the fragile\n",
      "being; but, shrinking back, Linton clung to his cousin, and implored\n",
      "her to accompany him, with a frantic importunity that admitted no\n",
      "denial. However I disapproved, I couldn’t hinder her: indeed, how could\n",
      "she have refused him herself? What was filling him with dread we had no\n",
      "means of discerning; but there he was, powerless under its gripe, and\n",
      "any addition seemed capable of shocking him into idiocy. We reached the\n",
      "threshold; Catherine walked in, and I stood waiting till she had\n",
      "conducted the invalid to a chair, expecting her out immediately; when\n",
      "Mr. Heathcliff, pushing me forward, exclaimed—“My house is not stricken\n",
      "with the plague, Nelly; and I have a mind to be hospitable to-day: sit\n",
      "down, and allow me to shut the door.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He shut and locked it also. I started.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shall have tea before you go home,” he added. “I am by myself.\n",
      "Hareton is gone with some cattle to the Lees, and Zillah and Joseph are\n",
      "off on a journey of pleasure; and, though I’m used to being alone, I’d\n",
      "rather have some interesting company, if I can get it. Miss Linton,\n",
      "take your seat by _him_. I give you what I have: the present is hardly\n",
      "worth accepting; but I have nothing else to offer. It is Linton, I\n",
      "mean. How she does stare! It’s odd what a savage feeling I have to\n",
      "anything that seems afraid of me! Had I been born where laws are less\n",
      "strict and tastes less dainty, I should treat myself to a slow\n",
      "vivisection of those two, as an evening’s amusement.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He drew in his breath, struck the table, and swore to himself, “By\n",
      "hell! I hate them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not afraid of you!” exclaimed Catherine, who could not hear the\n",
      "latter part of his speech. She stepped close up; her black eyes\n",
      "flashing with passion and resolution. “Give me that key: I will have\n",
      "it!” she said. “I wouldn’t eat or drink here, if I were starving.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table. He\n",
      "looked up, seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness; or,\n",
      "possibly, reminded, by her voice and glance, of the person from whom\n",
      "she inherited it. She snatched at the instrument, and half succeeded in\n",
      "getting it out of his loosened fingers: but her action recalled him to\n",
      "the present; he recovered it speedily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Catherine Linton,” he said, “stand off, or I shall knock you\n",
      "down; and that will make Mrs. Dean mad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of this warning, she captured his closed hand and its\n",
      "contents again. “We _will_ go!” she repeated, exerting her utmost\n",
      "efforts to cause the iron muscles to relax; and finding that her nails\n",
      "made no impression, she applied her teeth pretty sharply. Heathcliff\n",
      "glanced at me a glance that kept me from interfering a moment.\n",
      "Catherine was too intent on his fingers to notice his face. He opened\n",
      "them suddenly, and resigned the object of dispute; but, ere she had\n",
      "well secured it, he seized her with the liberated hand, and, pulling\n",
      "her on his knee, administered with the other a shower of terrific slaps\n",
      "on both sides of the head, each sufficient to have fulfilled his\n",
      "threat, had she been able to fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this diabolical violence I rushed on him furiously. “You villain!” I\n",
      "began to cry, “you villain!” A touch on the chest silenced me: I am\n",
      "stout, and soon put out of breath; and, what with that and the rage, I\n",
      "staggered dizzily back, and felt ready to suffocate, or to burst a\n",
      "blood-vessel. The scene was over in two minutes; Catherine, released,\n",
      "put her two hands to her temples, and looked just as if she were not\n",
      "sure whether her ears were off or on. She trembled like a reed, poor\n",
      "thing, and leant against the table perfectly bewildered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know how to chastise children, you see,” said the scoundrel, grimly,\n",
      "as he stooped to repossess himself of the key, which had dropped to the\n",
      "floor. “Go to Linton now, as I told you; and cry at your ease! I shall\n",
      "be your father, to-morrow—all the father you’ll have in a few days—and\n",
      "you shall have plenty of that. You can bear plenty; you’re no weakling:\n",
      "you shall have a daily taste, if I catch such a devil of a temper in\n",
      "your eyes again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Cathy ran to me instead of Linton, and knelt down and put her burning\n",
      "cheek on my lap, weeping aloud. Her cousin had shrunk into a corner of\n",
      "the settle, as quiet as a mouse, congratulating himself, I dare say,\n",
      "that the correction had alighted on another than him. Mr. Heathcliff,\n",
      "perceiving us all confounded, rose, and expeditiously made the tea\n",
      "himself. The cups and saucers were laid ready. He poured it out, and\n",
      "handed me a cup.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wash away your spleen,” he said. “And help your own naughty pet and\n",
      "mine. It is not poisoned, though I prepared it. I’m going out to seek\n",
      "your horses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Our first thought, on his departure, was to force an exit somewhere. We\n",
      "tried the kitchen door, but that was fastened outside: we looked at the\n",
      "windows—they were too narrow for even Cathy’s little figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Master Linton,” I cried, seeing we were regularly imprisoned, “you\n",
      "know what your diabolical father is after, and you shall tell us, or\n",
      "I’ll box your ears, as he has done your cousin’s.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Linton, you must tell,” said Catherine. “It was for your sake I\n",
      "came; and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give me some tea, I’m thirsty, and then I’ll tell you,” he answered.\n",
      "“Mrs. Dean, go away. I don’t like you standing over me. Now, Catherine,\n",
      "you are letting your tears fall into my cup. I won’t drink that. Give\n",
      "me another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Catherine pushed another to him, and wiped her face. I felt disgusted\n",
      "at the little wretch’s composure, since he was no longer in terror for\n",
      "himself. The anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided as soon as\n",
      "ever he entered Wuthering Heights; so I guessed he had been menaced\n",
      "with an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us there;\n",
      "and, that accomplished, he had no further immediate fears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Papa wants us to be married,” he continued, after sipping some of the\n",
      "liquid. “And he knows your papa wouldn’t let us marry now; and he’s\n",
      "afraid of my dying if we wait; so we are to be married in the morning,\n",
      "and you are to stay here all night; and, if you do as he wishes, you\n",
      "shall return home next day, and take me with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take you with her, pitiful changeling!” I exclaimed. “_You_ marry?\n",
      "Why, the man is mad! or he thinks us fools, every one. And do you\n",
      "imagine that beautiful young lady, that healthy, hearty girl, will tie\n",
      "herself to a little perishing monkey like you? Are you cherishing the\n",
      "notion that _anybody_, let alone Miss Catherine Linton, would have you\n",
      "for a husband? You want whipping for bringing us in here at all, with\n",
      "your dastardly puling tricks: and—don’t look so silly, now! I’ve a very\n",
      "good mind to shake you severely, for your contemptible treachery, and\n",
      "your imbecile conceit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I did give him a slight shaking; but it brought on the cough, and he\n",
      "took to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping, and Catherine\n",
      "rebuked me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stay all night? No,” she said, looking slowly round. “Ellen, I’ll burn\n",
      "that door down but I’ll get out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And she would have commenced the execution of her threat directly, but\n",
      "Linton was up in alarm for his dear self again. He clasped her in his\n",
      "two feeble arms sobbing:—“Won’t you have me, and save me? not let me\n",
      "come to the Grange? Oh, darling Catherine! you mustn’t go and leave,\n",
      "after all. You _must_ obey my father—you _must_!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must obey my own,” she replied, “and relieve him from this cruel\n",
      "suspense. The whole night! What would he think? He’ll be distressed\n",
      "already. I’ll either break or burn a way out of the house. Be quiet!\n",
      "You’re in no danger; but if you hinder me—Linton, I love papa better\n",
      "than you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The mortal terror he felt of Mr. Heathcliff’s anger restored to the boy\n",
      "his coward’s eloquence. Catherine was near distraught: still, she\n",
      "persisted that she must go home, and tried entreaty in her turn,\n",
      "persuading him to subdue his selfish agony. While they were thus\n",
      "occupied, our jailor re-entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your beasts have trotted off,” he said, “and—now Linton! snivelling\n",
      "again? What has she been doing to you? Come, come—have done, and get to\n",
      "bed. In a month or two, my lad, you’ll be able to pay her back her\n",
      "present tyrannies with a vigorous hand. You’re pining for pure love,\n",
      "are you not? nothing else in the world: and she shall have you! There,\n",
      "to bed! Zillah won’t be here to-night; you must undress yourself. Hush!\n",
      "hold your noise! Once in your own room, I’ll not come near you: you\n",
      "needn’t fear. By chance, you’ve managed tolerably. I’ll look to the\n",
      "rest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke these words, holding the door open for his son to pass, and\n",
      "the latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected\n",
      "the person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze. The lock\n",
      "was re-secured. Heathcliff approached the fire, where my mistress and I\n",
      "stood silent. Catherine looked up, and instinctively raised her hand to\n",
      "her cheek: his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation. Anybody else\n",
      "would have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness,\n",
      "but he scowled on her and muttered—“Oh! you are not afraid of me? Your\n",
      "courage is well disguised: you _seem_ damnably afraid!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I _am_ afraid now,” she replied, “because, if I stay, papa will be\n",
      "miserable: and how can I endure making him miserable—when he—when\n",
      "he—Mr. Heathcliff, _let_ me go home! I promise to marry Linton: papa\n",
      "would like me to: and I love him. Why should you wish to force me to do\n",
      "what I’ll willingly do of myself?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let him dare to force you,” I cried. “There’s law in the land, thank\n",
      "God! there is; though we be in an out-of-the-way place. I’d inform if\n",
      "he were my own son: and it’s felony without benefit of clergy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Silence!” said the ruffian. “To the devil with your clamour! I don’t\n",
      "want _you_ to speak. Miss Linton, I shall enjoy myself remarkably in\n",
      "thinking your father will be miserable: I shall not sleep for\n",
      "satisfaction. You could have hit on no surer way of fixing your\n",
      "residence under my roof for the next twenty-four hours than informing\n",
      "me that such an event would follow. As to your promise to marry Linton,\n",
      "I’ll take care you shall keep it; for you shall not quit this place\n",
      "till it is fulfilled.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Send Ellen, then, to let papa know I’m safe!” exclaimed Catherine,\n",
      "weeping bitterly. “Or marry me now. Poor papa! Ellen, he’ll think we’re\n",
      "lost. What shall we do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not he! He’ll think you are tired of waiting on him, and run off for a\n",
      "little amusement,” answered Heathcliff. “You cannot deny that you\n",
      "entered my house of your own accord, in contempt of his injunctions to\n",
      "the contrary. And it is quite natural that you should desire amusement\n",
      "at your age; and that you would weary of nursing a sick man, and that\n",
      "man _only_ your father. Catherine, his happiest days were over when\n",
      "your days began. He cursed you, I dare say, for coming into the world\n",
      "(I did, at least); and it would just do if he cursed you as _he_ went\n",
      "out of it. I’d join him. I don’t love you! How should I? Weep away. As\n",
      "far as I can see, it will be your chief diversion hereafter; unless\n",
      "Linton make amends for other losses: and your provident parent appears\n",
      "to fancy he may. His letters of advice and consolation entertained me\n",
      "vastly. In his last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his; and\n",
      "kind to her when he got her. Careful and kind—that’s paternal. But\n",
      "Linton requires his whole stock of care and kindness for himself.\n",
      "Linton can play the little tyrant well. He’ll undertake to torture any\n",
      "number of cats, if their teeth be drawn and their claws pared. You’ll\n",
      "be able to tell his uncle fine tales of his _kindness_, when you get\n",
      "home again, I assure you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re right there!” I said; “explain your son’s character. Show his\n",
      "resemblance to yourself: and then, I hope, Miss Cathy will think twice\n",
      "before she takes the cockatrice!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now,” he answered;\n",
      "“because she must either accept him or remain a prisoner, and you along\n",
      "with her, till your master dies. I can detain you both, quite\n",
      "concealed, here. If you doubt, encourage her to retract her word, and\n",
      "you’ll have an opportunity of judging!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll not retract my word,” said Catherine. “I’ll marry him within this\n",
      "hour, if I may go to Thrushcross Grange afterwards. Mr. Heathcliff,\n",
      "you’re a cruel man, but you’re not a fiend; and you won’t, from _mere_\n",
      "malice, destroy irrevocably all my happiness. If papa thought I had\n",
      "left him on purpose, and if he died before I returned, could I bear to\n",
      "live? I’ve given over crying: but I’m going to kneel here, at your\n",
      "knee; and I’ll not get up, and I’ll not take my eyes from your face\n",
      "till you look back at me! No, don’t turn away! _do_ look! you’ll see\n",
      "nothing to provoke you. I don’t hate you. I’m not angry that you struck\n",
      "me. Have you never loved _anybody_ in all your life, uncle? _never_?\n",
      "Ah! you must look once. I’m so wretched, you can’t help being sorry and\n",
      "pitying me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep your eft’s fingers off; and move, or I’ll kick you!” cried\n",
      "Heathcliff, brutally repulsing her. “I’d rather be hugged by a snake.\n",
      "How the devil can you dream of fawning on me? I _detest_ you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He shrugged his shoulders: shook himself, indeed, as if his flesh crept\n",
      "with aversion; and thrust back his chair; while I got up, and opened my\n",
      "mouth, to commence a downright torrent of abuse. But I was rendered\n",
      "dumb in the middle of the first sentence, by a threat that I should be\n",
      "shown into a room by myself the very next syllable I uttered. It was\n",
      "growing dark—we heard a sound of voices at the garden-gate. Our host\n",
      "hurried out instantly: _he_ had his wits about him; _we_ had not. There\n",
      "was a talk of two or three minutes, and he returned alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought it had been your cousin Hareton,” I observed to Catherine.\n",
      "“I wish he would arrive! Who knows but he might take our part?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was three servants sent to seek you from the Grange,” said\n",
      "Heathcliff, overhearing me. “You should have opened a lattice and\n",
      "called out: but I could swear that chit is glad you didn’t. She’s glad\n",
      "to be obliged to stay, I’m certain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At learning the chance we had missed, we both gave vent to our grief\n",
      "without control; and he allowed us to wail on till nine o’clock. Then\n",
      "he bid us go upstairs, through the kitchen, to Zillah’s chamber; and I\n",
      "whispered my companion to obey: perhaps we might contrive to get\n",
      "through the window there, or into a garret, and out by its skylight.\n",
      "The window, however, was narrow, like those below, and the garret trap\n",
      "was safe from our attempts; for we were fastened in as before. We\n",
      "neither of us lay down: Catherine took her station by the lattice, and\n",
      "watched anxiously for morning; a deep sigh being the only answer I\n",
      "could obtain to my frequent entreaties that she would try to rest. I\n",
      "seated myself in a chair, and rocked to and fro, passing harsh judgment\n",
      "on my many derelictions of duty; from which, it struck me then, all the\n",
      "misfortunes of my employers sprang. It was not the case, in reality, I\n",
      "am aware; but it was, in my imagination, that dismal night; and I\n",
      "thought Heathcliff himself less guilty than I.\n",
      "\n",
      "At seven o’clock he came, and inquired if Miss Linton had risen. She\n",
      "ran to the door immediately, and answered, “Yes.” “Here, then,” he\n",
      "said, opening it, and pulling her out. I rose to follow, but he turned\n",
      "the lock again. I demanded my release.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be patient,” he replied; “I’ll send up your breakfast in a while.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I thumped on the panels, and rattled the latch angrily; and Catherine\n",
      "asked why I was still shut up? He answered, I must try to endure it\n",
      "another hour, and they went away. I endured it two or three hours; at\n",
      "length, I heard a footstep: not Heathcliff’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve brought you something to eat,” said a voice; “oppen t’ door!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Complying eagerly, I beheld Hareton, laden with food enough to last me\n",
      "all day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tak’ it,” he added, thrusting the tray into my hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stay one minute,” I began.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay,” cried he, and retired, regardless of any prayers I could pour\n",
      "forth to detain him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there I remained enclosed the whole day, and the whole of the next\n",
      "night; and another, and another. Five nights and four days I remained,\n",
      "altogether, seeing nobody but Hareton once every morning; and he was a\n",
      "model of a jailor: surly, and dumb, and deaf to every attempt at moving\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the fifth morning, or rather afternoon, a different step\n",
      "approached—lighter and shorter; and, this time, the person entered the\n",
      "room. It was Zillah; donned in her scarlet shawl, with a black silk\n",
      "bonnet on her head, and a willow-basket swung to her arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eh, dear! Mrs. Dean!” she exclaimed. “Well! there is a talk about you\n",
      "at Gimmerton. I never thought but you were sunk in the Blackhorse\n",
      "marsh, and missy with you, till master told me you’d been found, and\n",
      "he’d lodged you here! What! and you must have got on an island, sure?\n",
      "And how long were you in the hole? Did master save you, Mrs. Dean? But\n",
      "you’re not so thin—you’ve not been so poorly, have you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your master is a true scoundrel!” I replied. “But he shall answer for\n",
      "it. He needn’t have raised that tale: it shall all be laid bare!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean?” asked Zillah. “It’s not his tale: they tell that in\n",
      "the village—about your being lost in the marsh; and I calls to\n",
      "Earnshaw, when I come in—‘Eh, they’s queer things, Mr. Hareton,\n",
      "happened since I went off. It’s a sad pity of that likely young lass,\n",
      "and cant Nelly Dean.’ He stared. I thought he had not heard aught, so I\n",
      "told him the rumour. The master listened, and he just smiled to\n",
      "himself, and said, ‘If they have been in the marsh, they are out now,\n",
      "Zillah. Nelly Dean is lodged, at this minute, in your room. You can\n",
      "tell her to flit, when you go up; here is the key. The bog-water got\n",
      "into her head, and she would have run home quite flighty, but I fixed\n",
      "her till she came round to her senses. You can bid her go to the Grange\n",
      "at once, if she be able, and carry a message from me, that her young\n",
      "lady will follow in time to attend the squire’s funeral.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Edgar is not dead?” I gasped. “Oh! Zillah, Zillah!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no; sit you down, my good mistress,” she replied; “you’re right\n",
      "sickly yet. He’s not dead; Doctor Kenneth thinks he may last another\n",
      "day. I met him on the road and asked.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of sitting down, I snatched my outdoor things, and hastened\n",
      "below, for the way was free. On entering the house, I looked about for\n",
      "some one to give information of Catherine. The place was filled with\n",
      "sunshine, and the door stood wide open; but nobody seemed at hand. As I\n",
      "hesitated whether to go off at once, or return and seek my mistress, a\n",
      "slight cough drew my attention to the hearth. Linton lay on the settle,\n",
      "sole tenant, sucking a stick of sugar-candy, and pursuing my movements\n",
      "with apathetic eyes. “Where is Miss Catherine?” I demanded sternly,\n",
      "supposing I could frighten him into giving intelligence, by catching\n",
      "him thus, alone. He sucked on like an innocent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is she gone?” I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” he replied; “she’s upstairs: she’s not to go; we won’t let her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You won’t let her, little idiot!” I exclaimed. “Direct me to her room\n",
      "immediately, or I’ll make you sing out sharply.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Papa would make you sing out, if you attempted to get there,” he\n",
      "answered. “He says I’m not to be soft with Catherine: she’s my wife,\n",
      "and it’s shameful that she should wish to leave me. He says she hates\n",
      "me and wants me to die, that she may have my money; but she shan’t have\n",
      "it: and she shan’t go home! She never shall!—she may cry, and be sick\n",
      "as much as she pleases!”\n",

      "drop asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Master Heathcliff,” I resumed, “have you forgotten all Catherine’s\n",
      "kindness to you last winter, when you affirmed you loved her, and when\n",
      "she brought you books and sung you songs, and came many a time through\n",
      "wind and snow to see you? She wept to miss one evening, because you\n",
      "would be disappointed; and you felt then that she was a hundred times\n",
      "too good to you: and now you believe the lies your father tells, though\n",
      "you know he detests you both. And you join him against her. That’s fine\n",
      "gratitude, is it not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The corner of Linton’s mouth fell, and he took the sugar-candy from his\n",
      "lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did she come to Wuthering Heights because she hated you?” I continued.\n",
      "“Think for yourself! As to your money, she does not even know that you\n",
      "will have any. And you say she’s sick; and yet you leave her alone, up\n",
      "there in a strange house! _You_ who have felt what it is to be so\n",
      "neglected! You could pity your own sufferings; and she pitied them,\n",
      "too; but you won’t pity hers! I shed tears, Master Heathcliff, you\n",
      "see—an elderly woman, and a servant merely—and you, after pretending\n",
      "such affection, and having reason to worship her almost, store every\n",
      "tear you have for yourself, and lie there quite at ease. Ah! you’re a\n",
      "heartless, selfish boy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t stay with her,” he answered crossly. “I’ll not stay by myself.\n",
      "She cries so I can’t bear it. And she won’t give over, though I say\n",
      "I’ll call my father. I did call him once, and he threatened to strangle\n",
      "her if she was not quiet; but she began again the instant he left the\n",
      "room, moaning and grieving all night long, though I screamed for\n",
      "vexation that I couldn’t sleep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is Mr. Heathcliff out?” I inquired, perceiving that the wretched\n",
      "creature had no power to sympathise with his cousin’s mental tortures.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s in the court,” he replied, “talking to Doctor Kenneth; who says\n",
      "uncle is dying, truly, at last. I’m glad, for I shall be master of the\n",
      "Grange after him. Catherine always spoke of it as _her_ house. It isn’t\n",
      "hers! It’s mine: papa says everything she has is mine. All her nice\n",
      "books are mine; she offered to give me them, and her pretty birds, and\n",
      "her pony Minny, if I would get the key of our room, and let her out;\n",
      "but I told her she had nothing to give, they were all, all mine. And\n",
      "then she cried, and took a little picture from her neck, and said I\n",
      "should have that; two pictures in a gold case, on one side her mother,\n",
      "and on the other uncle, when they were young. That was yesterday—I said\n",
      "_they_ were mine, too; and tried to get them from her. The spiteful\n",
      "thing wouldn’t let me: she pushed me off, and hurt me. I shrieked\n",
      "out—that frightens her—she heard papa coming, and she broke the hinges\n",
      "and divided the case, and gave me her mother’s portrait; the other she\n",
      "attempted to hide: but papa asked what was the matter, and I explained\n",
      "it. He took the one I had away, and ordered her to resign hers to me;\n",
      "she refused, and he—he struck her down, and wrenched it off the chain,\n",
      "and crushed it with his foot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And were you pleased to see her struck?” I asked: having my designs in\n",
      "encouraging his talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I winked,” he answered: “I wink to see my father strike a dog or a\n",
      "horse, he does it so hard. Yet I was glad at first—she deserved\n",
      "punishing for pushing me: but when papa was gone, she made me come to\n",
      "the window and showed me her cheek cut on the inside, against her\n",
      "teeth, and her mouth filling with blood; and then she gathered up the\n",
      "bits of the picture, and went and sat down with her face to the wall,\n",
      "and she has never spoken to me since: and I sometimes think she can’t\n",
      "speak for pain. I don’t like to think so; but she’s a naughty thing for\n",
      "crying continually; and she looks so pale and wild, I’m afraid of her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you can get the key if you choose?” I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, when I am upstairs,” he answered; “but I can’t walk upstairs\n",
      "now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In what apartment is it?” I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh,” he cried, “I shan’t tell _you_ where it is. It is our secret.\n",
      "Nobody, neither Hareton nor Zillah, is to know. There! you’ve tired\n",
      "me—go away, go away!” And he turned his face on to his arm, and shut\n",
      "his eyes again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I considered it best to depart without seeing Mr. Heathcliff, and bring\n",
      "a rescue for my young lady from the Grange. On reaching it, the\n",
      "astonishment of my fellow-servants to see me, and their joy also, was\n",
      "intense; and when they heard that their little mistress was safe, two\n",
      "or three were about to hurry up and shout the news at Mr. Edgar’s door:\n",
      "but I bespoke the announcement of it myself. How changed I found him,\n",
      "even in those few days! He lay an image of sadness and resignation\n",
      "awaiting his death. Very young he looked: though his actual age was\n",
      "thirty-nine, one would have called him ten years younger, at least. He\n",
      "thought of Catherine; for he murmured her name. I touched his hand, and\n",
      "spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Catherine is coming, dear master!” I whispered; “she is alive and\n",
      "well; and will be here, I hope, to-night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I trembled at the first effects of this intelligence: he half rose up,\n",
      "looked eagerly round the apartment, and then sank back in a swoon. As\n",
      "soon as he recovered, I related our compulsory visit, and detention at\n",
      "the Heights. I said Heathcliff forced me to go in: which was not quite\n",
      "true. I uttered as little as possible against Linton; nor did I\n",
      "describe all his father’s brutal conduct—my intentions being to add no\n",
      "bitterness, if I could help it, to his already overflowing cup.\n",
      "\n",
      "He divined that one of his enemy’s purposes was to secure the personal\n",
      "property, as well as the estate, to his son: or rather himself; yet why\n",
      "he did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master, because\n",
      "ignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together.\n",
      "However, he felt that his will had better be altered: instead of\n",
      "leaving Catherine’s fortune at her own disposal, he determined to put\n",
      "it in the hands of trustees for her use during life, and for her\n",
      "children, if she had any, after her. By that means, it could not fall\n",
      "to Mr. Heathcliff should Linton die.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having received his orders, I despatched a man to fetch the attorney,\n",
      "and four more, provided with serviceable weapons, to demand my young\n",
      "lady of her jailor. Both parties were delayed very late. The single\n",
      "servant returned first. He said Mr. Green, the lawyer, was out when he\n",
      "arrived at his house, and he had to wait two hours for his re-entrance;\n",
      "and then Mr. Green told him he had a little business in the village\n",
      "that must be done; but he would be at Thrushcross Grange before\n",
      "morning. The four men came back unaccompanied also. They brought word\n",
      "that Catherine was ill: too ill to quit her room; and Heathcliff would\n",
      "not suffer them to see her. I scolded the stupid fellows well for\n",
      "listening to that tale, which I would not carry to my master; resolving\n",
      "to take a whole bevy up to the Heights, at daylight, and storm it\n",
      "literally, unless the prisoner were quietly surrendered to us. Her\n",
      "father _shall_ see her, I vowed, and vowed again, if that devil be\n",
      "killed on his own door-stones in trying to prevent it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Happily, I was spared the journey and the trouble. I had gone\n",
      "downstairs at three o’clock to fetch a jug of water; and was passing\n",
      "through the hall with it in my hand, when a sharp knock at the front\n",
      "door made me jump. “Oh! it is Green,” I said, recollecting myself—“only\n",
      "Green,” and I went on, intending to send somebody else to open it; but\n",
      "the knock was repeated: not loud, and still importunately. I put the\n",
      "jug on the banister and hastened to admit him myself. The harvest moon\n",
      "shone clear outside. It was not the attorney. My own sweet little\n",
      "mistress sprang on my neck sobbing, “Ellen, Ellen! Is papa alive?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” I cried: “yes, my angel, he is, God be thanked, you are safe\n",
      "with us again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She wanted to run, breathless as she was, upstairs to Mr. Linton’s\n",
      "room; but I compelled her to sit down on a chair, and made her drink,\n",
      "and washed her pale face, chafing it into a faint colour with my apron.\n",
      "Then I said I must go first, and tell of her arrival; imploring her to\n",
      "say, she should be happy with young Heathcliff. She stared, but soon\n",
      "comprehending why I counselled her to utter the falsehood, she assured\n",
      "me she would not complain.\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn’t abide to be present at their meeting. I stood outside the\n",
      "chamber-door a quarter of an hour, and hardly ventured near the bed,\n",
      "then. All was composed, however: Catherine’s despair was as silent as\n",
      "her father’s joy. She supported him calmly, in appearance; and he fixed\n",
      "on her features his raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy.\n",
      "\n",
      "He died blissfully, Mr. Lockwood: he died so. Kissing her cheek, he\n",
      "murmured,—“I am going to her; and you, darling child, shall come to\n",
      "us!” and never stirred or spoke again; but continued that rapt, radiant\n",
      "gaze, till his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed. None\n",
      "could have noticed the exact minute of his death, it was so entirely\n",
      "without a struggle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether Catherine had spent her tears, or whether the grief were too\n",
      "weighty to let them flow, she sat there dry-eyed till the sun rose: she\n",
      "sat till noon, and would still have remained brooding over that\n",
      "deathbed, but I insisted on her coming away and taking some repose. It\n",
      "was well I succeeded in removing her, for at dinner-time appeared the\n",
      "lawyer, having called at Wuthering Heights to get his instructions how\n",
      "to behave. He had sold himself to Mr. Heathcliff: that was the cause of\n",
      "his delay in obeying my master’s summons. Fortunately, no thought of\n",
      "worldly affairs crossed the latter’s mind, to disturb him, after his\n",
      "daughter’s arrival.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the\n",
      "place. He gave all the servants but me, notice to quit. He would have\n",
      "carried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that Edgar\n",
      "Linton should not be buried beside his wife, but in the chapel, with\n",
      "his family. There was the will, however, to hinder that, and my loud\n",
      "protestations against any infringement of its directions. The funeral\n",
      "was hurried over; Catherine, Mrs. Linton Heathcliff now, was suffered\n",
      "to stay at the Grange till her father’s corpse had quitted it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She told me that her anguish had at last spurred Linton to incur the\n",
      "risk of liberating her. She heard the men I sent disputing at the door,\n",
      "and she gathered the sense of Heathcliff’s answer. It drove her\n",
      "desperate. Linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon\n",
      "after I left, was terrified into fetching the key before his father\n",
      "re-ascended. He had the cunning to unlock and re-lock the door, without\n",
      "shutting it; and when he should have gone to bed, he begged to sleep\n",
      "with Hareton, and his petition was granted for once. Catherine stole\n",
      "out before break of day. She dared not try the doors lest the dogs\n",
      "should raise an alarm; she visited the empty chambers and examined\n",
      "their windows; and, luckily, lighting on her mother’s, she got easily\n",
      "out of its lattice, and on to the ground, by means of the fir-tree\n",
      "close by. Her accomplice suffered for his share in the escape,\n",
      "notwithstanding his timid contrivances.\n",

      "CHAPTER XXIX\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening after the funeral, my young lady and I were seated in the\n",
      "library; now musing mournfully—one of us despairingly—on our loss, now\n",
      "venturing conjectures as to the gloomy future.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had just agreed the best destiny which could await Catherine would\n",
      "be a permission to continue resident at the Grange; at least during\n",
      "Linton’s life: he being allowed to join her there, and I to remain as\n",
      "housekeeper. That seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be\n",
      "hoped for; and yet I did hope, and began to cheer up under the prospect\n",
      "of retaining my home and my employment, and, above all, my beloved\n",
      "young mistress; when a servant—one of the discarded ones, not yet\n",
      "departed—rushed hastily in, and said “that devil Heathcliff” was coming\n",
      "through the court: should he fasten the door in his face?\n",
      "\n",
      "If we had been mad enough to order that proceeding, we had not time. He\n",
      "made no ceremony of knocking or announcing his name: he was master, and\n",
      "availed himself of the master’s privilege to walk straight in, without\n",
      "saying a word. The sound of our informant’s voice directed him to the\n",
      "library; he entered and motioning him out, shut the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the same room into which he had been ushered, as a guest,\n",
      "eighteen years before: the same moon shone through the window; and the\n",
      "same autumn landscape lay outside. We had not yet lighted a candle, but\n",
      "all the apartment was visible, even to the portraits on the wall: the\n",
      "splendid head of Mrs. Linton, and the graceful one of her husband.\n",
      "Heathcliff advanced to the hearth. Time had little altered his person\n",
      "either. There was the same man: his dark face rather sallower and more\n",
      "composed, his frame a stone or two heavier, perhaps, and no other\n",
      "difference. Catherine had risen with an impulse to dash out, when she\n",
      "saw him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stop!” he said, arresting her by the arm. “No more runnings away!\n",
      "Where would you go? I’m come to fetch you home; and I hope you’ll be a\n",
      "dutiful daughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience. I\n",
      "was embarrassed how to punish him when I discovered his part in the\n",
      "business: he’s such a cobweb, a pinch would annihilate him; but you’ll\n",
      "see by his look that he has received his due! I brought him down one\n",
      "evening, the day before yesterday, and just set him in a chair, and\n",
      "never touched him afterwards. I sent Hareton out, and we had the room\n",
      "to ourselves. In two hours, I called Joseph to carry him up again; and\n",
      "since then my presence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost; and I\n",
      "fancy he sees me often, though I am not near. Hareton says he wakes and\n",
      "shrieks in the night by the hour together, and calls you to protect him\n",
      "from me; and, whether you like your precious mate, or not, you must\n",
      "come: he’s your concern now; I yield all my interest in him to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not let Catherine continue here,” I pleaded, “and send Master\n",
      "Linton to her? As you hate them both, you’d not miss them: they _can_\n",
      "only be a daily plague to your unnatural heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m seeking a tenant for the Grange,” he answered; “and I want my\n",
      "children about me, to be sure. Besides, that lass owes me her services\n",
      "for her bread. I’m not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness\n",
      "after Linton is gone. Make haste and get ready, now; and don’t oblige\n",
      "me to compel you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall,” said Catherine. “Linton is all I have to love in the world,\n",
      "and though you have done what you could to make him hateful to me, and\n",
      "me to him, you _cannot_ make us hate each other. And I defy you to hurt\n",
      "him when I am by, and I defy you to frighten me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a boastful champion,” replied Heathcliff; “but I don’t like\n",
      "you well enough to hurt him: you shall get the full benefit of the\n",
      "torment, as long as it lasts. It is not I who will make him hateful to\n",
      "you—it is his own sweet spirit. He’s as bitter as gall at your\n",
      "desertion and its consequences: don’t expect thanks for this noble\n",
      "devotion. I heard him draw a pleasant picture to Zillah of what he\n",
      "would do if he were as strong as I: the inclination is there, and his\n",
      "very weakness will sharpen his wits to find a substitute for strength.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know he has a bad nature,” said Catherine: “he’s your son. But I’m\n",
      "glad I’ve a better, to forgive it; and I know he loves me, and for that\n",
      "reason I love him. Mr. Heathcliff, _you_ have _nobody_ to love you;\n",
      "and, however miserable you make us, we shall still have the revenge of\n",
      "thinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery. You _are_\n",
      "miserable, are you not? Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him?\n",
      "_Nobody_ loves you—_nobody_ will cry for you when you die! I wouldn’t\n",
      "be you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Catherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph: she seemed to have made\n",
      "up her mind to enter into the spirit of her future family, and draw\n",
      "pleasure from the griefs of her enemies.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shall be sorry to be yourself presently,” said her father-in-law,\n",
      "“if you stand there another minute. Begone, witch, and get your\n",
      "things!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She scornfully withdrew. In her absence I began to beg for Zillah’s\n",
      "place at the Heights, offering to resign mine to her; but he would\n",
      "suffer it on no account. He bid me be silent; and then, for the first\n",
      "time, allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the\n",
      "pictures. Having studied Mrs. Linton’s, he said—“I shall have that\n",
      "home. Not because I need it, but—” He turned abruptly to the fire, and\n",
      "continued, with what, for lack of a better word, I must call a\n",
      "smile—“I’ll tell you what I did yesterday! I got the sexton, who was\n",
      "digging Linton’s grave, to remove the earth off her coffin lid, and I\n",
      "opened it. I thought, once, I would have stayed there: when I saw her\n",
      "face again—it is hers yet!—he had hard work to stir me; but he said it\n",
      "would change if the air blew on it, and so I struck one side of the\n",
      "coffin loose, and covered it up: not Linton’s side, damn him! I wish\n",
      "he’d been soldered in lead. And I bribed the sexton to pull it away\n",
      "when I’m laid there, and slide mine out too; I’ll have it made so: and\n",
      "then by the time Linton gets to us he’ll not know which is which!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You were very wicked, Mr. Heathcliff!” I exclaimed; “were you not\n",
      "ashamed to disturb the dead?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I disturbed nobody, Nelly,” he replied; “and I gave some ease to\n",
      "myself. I shall be a great deal more comfortable now; and you’ll have a\n",
      "better chance of keeping me underground, when I get there. Disturbed\n",
      "her? No! she has disturbed me, night and day, through eighteen\n",
      "years—incessantly—remorselessly—till yesternight; and yesternight I was\n",
      "tranquil. I dreamt I was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper, with\n",
      "my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And if she had been dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you\n",
      "have dreamt of then?” I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of dissolving with her, and being more happy still!” he answered. “Do\n",
      "you suppose I dread any change of that sort? I expected such a\n",
      "transformation on raising the lid, but I’m better pleased that it should\n",
      "not commence till I share it. Besides, unless I had received a distinct\n",
      "impression of her passionless features, that strange feeling would\n",
      "hardly have been removed. It began oddly. You know I was wild after she\n",
      "died; and eternally, from dawn to dawn, praying her to return to me her\n",
      "spirit! I have a strong faith in ghosts: I have a conviction that they\n",
      "can, and do, exist among us! The day she was buried, there came a fall\n",
      "of snow. In the evening I went to the churchyard. It blew bleak as\n",
      "winter—all round was solitary. I didn’t fear that her fool of a husband\n",
      "would wander up the glen so late; and no one else had business to bring\n",
      "them there. Being alone, and conscious two yards of loose earth was the\n",
      "sole barrier between us, I said to myself—‘I’ll have her in my arms\n",
      "again! If she be cold, I’ll think it is this north wind that chills\n",
      "_me_; and if she be motionless, it is sleep.’ I got a spade from the\n",
      "tool-house, and began to delve with all my might—it scraped the coffin;\n",
      "I fell to work with my hands; the wood commenced cracking about the\n",
      "screws; I was on the point of attaining my object, when it seemed that\n",
      "I heard a sigh from some one above, close at the edge of the grave, and\n",
      "bending down. ‘If I can only get this off,’ I muttered, ‘I wish they\n",
      "may shovel in the earth over us both!’ and I wrenched at it more\n",
      "desperately still. There was another sigh, close at my ear. I appeared\n",
      "to feel the warm breath of it displacing the sleet-laden wind. I knew\n",
      "no living thing in flesh and blood was by; but, as certainly as you\n",
      "perceive the approach to some substantial body in the dark, though it\n",
      "cannot be discerned, so certainly I felt that Cathy was there: not\n",
      "under me, but on the earth. A sudden sense of relief flowed from my\n",
      "heart through every limb. I relinquished my labour of agony, and turned\n",
      "consoled at once: unspeakably consoled. Her presence was with me: it\n",
      "remained while I re-filled the grave, and led me home. You may laugh,\n",
      "if you will; but I was sure I should see her there. I was sure she was\n",
      "with me, and I could not help talking to her. Having reached the\n",
      "Heights, I rushed eagerly to the door. It was fastened; and, I\n",
      "remember, that accursed Earnshaw and my wife opposed my entrance. I\n",
      "remember stopping to kick the breath out of him, and then hurrying\n",
      "upstairs, to my room and hers. I looked round impatiently—I felt her by\n",
      "me—I could _almost_ see her, and yet I _could not_! I ought to have\n",

      "my supplications to have but one glimpse! I had not one. She showed\n",
      "herself, as she often was in life, a devil to me! And, since then,\n",
      "sometimes more and sometimes less, I’ve been the sport of that\n",
      "intolerable torture! Infernal! keeping my nerves at such a stretch\n",
      "that, if they had not resembled catgut, they would long ago have\n",
      "relaxed to the feebleness of Linton’s. When I sat in the house with\n",
      "Hareton, it seemed that on going out I should meet her; when I walked\n",
      "on the moors I should meet her coming in. When I went from home I\n",
      "hastened to return; she _must_ be somewhere at the Heights, I was\n",
      "certain! And when I slept in her chamber—I was beaten out of that. I\n",
      "couldn’t lie there; for the moment I closed my eyes, she was either\n",
      "outside the window, or sliding back the panels, or entering the room,\n",
      "or even resting her darling head on the same pillow as she did when a\n",
      "child; and I must open my lids to see. And so I opened and closed them\n",
      "a hundred times a night—to be always disappointed! It racked me! I’ve\n",
      "often groaned aloud, till that old rascal Joseph no doubt believed that\n",
      "my conscience was playing the fiend inside of me. Now, since I’ve seen\n",
      "her, I’m pacified—a little. It was a strange way of killing: not by\n",
      "inches, but by fractions of hairbreadths, to beguile me with the\n",
      "spectre of a hope through eighteen years!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead; his hair clung to it, wet\n",
      "with perspiration; his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire,\n",
      "the brows not contracted, but raised next the temples; diminishing the\n",
      "grim aspect of his countenance, but imparting a peculiar look of\n",
      "trouble, and a painful appearance of mental tension towards one\n",
      "absorbing subject. He only half addressed me, and I maintained silence.\n",
      "I didn’t like to hear him talk! After a short period he resumed his\n",
      "meditation on the picture, took it down and leant it against the sofa\n",
      "to contemplate it at better advantage; and while so occupied Catherine\n",
      "entered, announcing that she was ready, when her pony should be\n",
      "saddled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Send that over to-morrow,” said Heathcliff to me; then turning to her,\n",
      "he added: “You may do without your pony: it is a fine evening, and\n",
      "you’ll need no ponies at Wuthering Heights; for what journeys you take,\n",
      "your own feet will serve you. Come along.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good-bye, Ellen!” whispered my dear little mistress. As she kissed me,\n",
      "her lips felt like ice. “Come and see me, Ellen; don’t forget.”\n",

      "“Take care you do no such thing, Mrs. Dean!” said her new father. “When\n",

      "house!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He signed her to precede him; and casting back a look that cut my\n",
      "heart, she obeyed. I watched them, from the window, walk down the\n",
      "garden. Heathcliff fixed Catherine’s arm under his: though she disputed\n",

      "I have paid a visit to the Heights, but I have not seen her since she\n",
      "left: Joseph held the door in his hand when I called to ask after her,\n",
      "and wouldn’t let me pass. He said Mrs. Linton was “thrang,” and the\n",
      "master was not in. Zillah has told me something of the way they go on,\n",
      "otherwise I should hardly know who was dead and who living. She thinks\n",
      "Catherine haughty, and does not like her, I can guess by her talk. My\n",
      "young lady asked some aid of her when she first came; but Mr.\n",
      "Heathcliff told her to follow her own business, and let his\n",
      "daughter-in-law look after herself; and Zillah willingly acquiesced,\n",
      "being a narrow-minded, selfish woman. Catherine evinced a child’s\n",
      "annoyance at this neglect; repaid it with contempt, and thus enlisted\n",
      "my informant among her enemies, as securely as if she had done her some\n",
      "great wrong. I had a long talk with Zillah about six weeks ago, a\n",
      "little before you came, one day when we foregathered on the moor; and\n",
      "this is what she told me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The first thing Mrs. Linton did,” she said, “on her arrival at the\n",
      "Heights, was to run upstairs, without even wishing good-evening to me\n",
      "and Joseph; she shut herself into Linton’s room, and remained till\n",
      "morning. Then, while the master and Earnshaw were at breakfast, she\n",
      "entered the house, and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be\n",
      "sent for? her cousin was very ill.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘We know that!’ answered Heathcliff; ‘but his life is not worth a\n",
      "farthing, and I won’t spend a farthing on him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘But I cannot tell how to do,’ she said; ‘and if nobody will help me,\n",
      "he’ll die!’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Walk out of the room,’ cried the master, ‘and let me never hear a\n",
      "word more about him! None here care what becomes of him; if you do, act\n",
      "the nurse; if you do not, lock him up and leave him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then she began to bother me, and I said I’d had enough plague with the\n",
      "tiresome thing; we each had our tasks, and hers was to wait on Linton:\n",
      "Mr. Heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How they managed together, I can’t tell. I fancy he fretted a great\n",
      "deal, and moaned hisseln night and day; and she had precious little\n",
      "rest: one could guess by her white face and heavy eyes. She sometimes\n",
      "came into the kitchen all wildered like, and looked as if she would\n",
      "fain beg assistance; but I was not going to disobey the master: I never\n",
      "dare disobey him, Mrs. Dean; and, though I thought it wrong that\n",
      "Kenneth should not be sent for, it was no concern of mine either to\n",
      "advise or complain, and I always refused to meddle. Once or twice,\n",
      "after we had gone to bed, I’ve happened to open my door again and seen\n",
      "her sitting crying on the stairs’-top; and then I’ve shut myself in\n",
      "quick, for fear of being moved to interfere. I did pity her then, I’m\n",
      "sure: still I didn’t wish to lose my place, you know.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At last, one night she came boldly into my chamber, and frightened me\n",
      "out of my wits, by saying, ‘Tell Mr. Heathcliff that his son is\n",
      "dying—I’m sure he is, this time. Get up, instantly, and tell him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“Having uttered this speech, she vanished again. I lay a quarter of an\n",

      "\n",
      "“She’s mistaken, I said to myself. He’s got over it. I needn’t disturb\n",

      "sharp ringing of the bell—the only bell we have, put up on purpose for\n",

      "inform them that he wouldn’t have that noise repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I delivered Catherine’s message. He cursed to himself, and in a few\n",
      "minutes came out with a lighted candle, and proceeded to their room. I\n",
      "followed. Mrs. Heathcliff was seated by the bedside, with her hands\n",
      "folded on her knees. Her father-in-law went up, held the light to\n",

      "heard our talk from outside, now entered. Joseph was fain, I believe,\n",
      "of the lad’s removal; Hareton seemed a thought bothered: though he was\n",
      "more taken up with staring at Catherine than thinking of Linton. But\n",
      "the master bid him get off to bed again: we didn’t want his help. He\n",

      "\n",
      "“In the morning, he sent me to tell her she must come down to\n",

      "Cathy stayed upstairs a fortnight, according to Zillah; who visited her\n",
      "twice a day, and would have been rather more friendly, but her attempts\n",
      "at increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heathcliff went up once, to show her Linton’s will. He had bequeathed\n",
      "the whole of his, and what had been her, moveable property, to his\n",
      "father: the poor creature was threatened, or coaxed, into that act\n",
      "during her week’s absence, when his uncle died. The lands, being a\n",
      "minor, he could not meddle with. However, Mr. Heathcliff has claimed\n",
      "and kept them in his wife’s right and his also: I suppose legally; at\n",

      "\n",
      "“Nobody,” said Zillah, “ever approached her door, except that once, but\n",
      "I; and nobody asked anything about her. The first occasion of her\n",
      "coming down into the house was on a Sunday afternoon. She had cried\n",
      "out, when I carried up her dinner, that she couldn’t bear any longer\n",
      "being in the cold; and I told her the master was going to Thrushcross\n",
      "Grange, and Earnshaw and I needn’t hinder her from descending; so, as\n",
      "soon as she heard Heathcliff’s horse trot off, she made her appearance,\n",

      "has no minister now, explained Mrs. Dean; and they call the Methodists’\n",
      "or Baptists’ place, I can’t say which it is, at Gimmerton, a chapel.)\n",
      "“Joseph had gone,” she continued, “but I thought proper to bide at\n",
      "home. Young folks are always the better for an elder’s over-looking;\n",
      "and Hareton, with all his bashfulness, isn’t a model of nice behaviour.\n",
      "I let him know that his cousin would very likely sit with us, and she\n",
      "had been always used to see the Sabbath respected; so he had as good\n",
      "leave his guns and bits of indoor work alone, while she stayed. He\n",
      "coloured up at the news, and cast his eyes over his hands and clothes.\n",
      "The train-oil and gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a minute. I saw\n",
      "he meant to give her his company; and I guessed, by his way, he wanted\n",
      "to be presentable; so, laughing, as I durst not laugh when the master\n",
      "is by, I offered to help him, if he would, and joked at his confusion.\n",
      "He grew sullen, and began to swear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Mrs. Dean,” Zillah went on, seeing me not pleased by her manner,\n",

      "you’re right: but I own I should love well to bring her pride a peg\n",
      "lower. And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her,\n",
      "now? She’s as poor as you or I: poorer, I’ll be bound: you’re saving,\n",

      "Hareton allowed Zillah to give him her aid; and she flattered him into\n",

      "“Missis walked in,” she said, “as chill as an icicle, and as high as a\n",

      "turned up her nose at my civility. Earnshaw rose, too, and bid her come\n",
      "to the settle, and sit close by the fire: he was sure she was starved.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘I’ve been starved a month and more,’ she answered, resting on the\n",

      "\n",
      "“And she got a chair for herself, and placed it at a distance from both\n",
      "of us. Having sat till she was warm, she began to look round, and\n",
      "discovered a number of books on the dresser; she was instantly upon her\n",
      "feet again, stretching to reach them: but they were too high up. Her\n",
      "cousin, after watching her endeavours a while, at last summoned courage\n",
      "to help her; she held her frock, and he filled it with the first that\n",
      "came to hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That was a great advance for the lad. She didn’t thank him; still, he\n",
      "felt gratified that she had accepted his assistance, and ventured to\n",
      "stand behind as she examined them, and even to stoop and point out what\n",
      "struck his fancy in certain old pictures which they contained; nor was\n",
      "he daunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from his\n",
      "finger: he contented himself with going a bit farther back and looking\n",
      "at her instead of the book. She continued reading, or seeking for\n",
      "something to read. His attention became, by degrees, quite centred in\n",
      "the study of her thick silky curls: her face he couldn’t see, and she\n",
      "couldn’t see him. And, perhaps, not quite awake to what he did, but\n",
      "attracted like a child to a candle, at last he proceeded from staring\n",
      "to touching; he put out his hand and stroked one curl, as gently as if\n",
      "it were a bird. He might have stuck a knife into her neck, she started\n",
      "round in such a taking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Get away this moment! How dare you touch me? Why are you stopping\n",

      "then she put a few questions to me concerning the inmates, rational and\n",
      "irrational, of her former home; and gazing towards the hills, murmured\n",
      "in soliloquy:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should like to be riding Minny down there! I should like to be\n",
      "climbing up there! Oh! I’m tired—I’m _stalled_, Hareton!” And she leant\n",
      "her pretty head back against the sill, with half a yawn and half a\n",
      "sigh, and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness: neither caring\n",
      "nor knowing whether we remarked her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Heathcliff,” I said, after sitting some time mute, “you are not\n",
      "aware that I am an acquaintance of yours? so intimate that I think it\n",
      "strange you won’t come and speak to me. My housekeeper never wearies of\n",
      "talking about and praising you; and she’ll be greatly disappointed if I\n",
      "return with no news of or from you, except that you received her letter\n",
      "and said nothing!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She appeared to wonder at this speech, and asked,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does Ellen like you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, very well,” I replied, hesitatingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must tell her,” she continued, “that I would answer her letter,\n",
      "but I have no materials for writing: not even a book from which I might\n",
      "tear a leaf.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No books!” I exclaimed. “How do you contrive to live here without\n",
      "them? if I may take the liberty to inquire. Though provided with a\n",
      "large library, I’m frequently very dull at the Grange; take my books\n",
      "away, and I should be desperate!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was always reading, when I had them,” said Catherine; “and Mr.\n",
      "Heathcliff never reads; so he took it into his head to destroy my\n",
      "books. I have not had a glimpse of one for weeks. Only once, I searched\n",
      "through Joseph’s store of theology, to his great irritation; and once,\n",
      "Hareton, I came upon a secret stock in your room—some Latin and Greek,\n",
      "and some tales and poetry: all old friends. I brought the last here—and\n",
      "you gathered them, as a magpie gathers silver spoons, for the mere love\n",
      "of stealing! They are of no use to you; or else you concealed them in\n",
      "the bad spirit that, as you cannot enjoy them, nobody else shall.\n",
      "Perhaps _your_ envy counselled Mr. Heathcliff to rob me of my\n",
      "treasures? But I’ve most of them written on my brain and printed in my\n",
      "heart, and you cannot deprive me of those!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Earnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of his\n",
      "private literary accumulations, and stammered an indignant denial of\n",
      "her accusations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge,” I\n",
      "said, coming to his rescue. “He is not _envious_, but _emulous_ of your\n",
      "attainments. He’ll be a clever scholar in a few years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And he wants me to sink into a dunce, meantime,” answered Catherine.\n",
      "“Yes, I hear him trying to spell and read to himself, and pretty\n",
      "blunders he makes! I wish you would repeat Chevy Chase as you did\n",
      "yesterday: it was extremely funny. I heard you; and I heard you turning\n",
      "over the dictionary to seek out the hard words, and then cursing\n",
      "because you couldn’t read their explanations!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at\n",
      "for his ignorance, and then laughed at for trying to remove it. I had a\n",
      "similar notion; and, remembering Mrs. Dean’s anecdote of his first\n",
      "attempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared, I\n",
      "observed,—“But, Mrs. Heathcliff, we have each had a commencement, and\n",
      "each stumbled and tottered on the threshold; had our teachers scorned\n",
      "instead of aiding us, we should stumble and totter yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” she replied, “I don’t wish to limit his acquirements: still, he\n",
      "has no right to appropriate what is mine, and make it ridiculous to me\n",
      "with his vile mistakes and mispronunciations! Those books, both prose\n",
      "and verse, are consecrated to me by other associations; and I hate to\n",
      "have them debased and profaned in his mouth! Besides, of all, he has\n",
      "selected my favourite pieces that I love the most to repeat, as if out\n",
      "of deliberate malice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hareton’s chest heaved in silence a minute: he laboured under a severe\n",
      "sense of mortification and wrath, which it was no easy task to\n",
      "suppress. I rose, and, from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his\n",
      "embarrassment, took up my station in the doorway, surveying the\n",
      "external prospect as I stood. He followed my example, and left the\n",
      "room; but presently reappeared, bearing half a dozen volumes in his\n",
      "hands, which he threw into Catherine’s lap, exclaiming,—“Take them! I\n",
      "never want to hear, or read, or think of them again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won’t have them now,” she answered. “I shall connect them with you,\n",
      "and hate them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She opened one that had obviously been often turned over, and read a\n",
      "portion in the drawling tone of a beginner; then laughed, and threw it\n",
      "from her. “And listen,” she continued, provokingly, commencing a verse\n",
      "of an old ballad in the same fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "But his self-love would endure no further torment: I heard, and not\n",
      "altogether disapprovingly, a manual check given to her saucy tongue.\n",
      "The little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin’s sensitive\n",
      "though uncultivated feelings, and a physical argument was the only mode\n",
      "he had of balancing the account, and repaying its effects on the\n",
      "inflictor. He afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the\n",
      "fire. I read in his countenance what anguish it was to offer that\n",
      "sacrifice to spleen. I fancied that as they consumed, he recalled the\n",
      "pleasure they had already imparted, and the triumph and ever-increasing\n",
      "pleasure he had anticipated from them; and I fancied I guessed the\n",
      "incitement to his secret studies also. He had been content with daily\n",
      "labour and rough animal enjoyments, till Catherine crossed his path.\n",
      "Shame at her scorn, and hope of her approval, were his first prompters\n",
      "to higher pursuits; and instead of guarding him from one and winning\n",
      "him to the other, his endeavours to raise himself had produced just the\n",
      "contrary result.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, that’s all the good that such a brute as you can get from them!”\n",
      "cried Catherine, sucking her damaged lip, and watching the\n",
      "conflagration with indignant eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’d _better_ hold your tongue, now,” he answered fiercely.\n",
      "\n",
      "And his agitation precluded further speech; he advanced hastily to the\n",
      "entrance, where I made way for him to pass. But ere he had crossed the\n",
      "door-stones, Mr. Heathcliff, coming up the causeway, encountered him,\n",
      "and laying hold of his shoulder asked,—“What’s to do now, my lad?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Naught, naught,” he said, and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger\n",
      "in solitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heathcliff gazed after him, and sighed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will be odd if I thwart myself,” he muttered, unconscious that I\n",
      "was behind him. “But when I look for his father in his face, I find\n",
      "_her_ every day more! How the devil is he so like? I can hardly bear to\n",
      "see him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He bent his eyes to the ground, and walked moodily in. There was a\n",
      "restless, anxious expression in his countenance, I had never remarked\n",
      "there before; and he looked sparer in person. His daughter-in-law, on\n",
      "perceiving him through the window, immediately escaped to the kitchen,\n",
      "so that I remained alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m glad to see you out of doors again, Mr. Lockwood,” he said, in\n",
      "reply to my greeting; “from selfish motives partly: I don’t think I\n",
      "could readily supply your loss in this desolation. I’ve wondered more\n",
      "than once what brought you here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“An idle whim, I fear, sir,” was my answer; “or else an idle whim is\n",
      "going to spirit me away. I shall set out for London next week; and I\n",
      "must give you warning that I feel no disposition to retain Thrushcross\n",
      "Grange beyond the twelve months I agreed to rent it. I believe I shall\n",
      "not live there any more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, indeed; you’re tired of being banished from the world, are you?”\n",
      "he said. “But if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you\n",
      "won’t occupy, your journey is useless: I never relent in exacting my\n",
      "due from any one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m coming to plead off nothing about it,” I exclaimed, considerably\n",
      "irritated. “Should you wish it, I’ll settle with you now,” and I drew\n",
      "my note-book from my pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no,” he replied, coolly; “you’ll leave sufficient behind to cover\n",
      "your debts, if you fail to return: I’m not in such a hurry. Sit down\n",
      "and take your dinner with us; a guest that is safe from repeating his\n",
      "visit can generally be made welcome. Catherine! bring the things in:\n",
      "where are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Catherine reappeared, bearing a tray of knives and forks.\n",

      "She obeyed his directions very punctually: perhaps she had no\n",
      "temptation to transgress. Living among clowns and misanthropists, she\n",
      "probably cannot appreciate a better class of people when she meets\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Mr. Heathcliff, grim and saturnine, on the one hand, and Hareton,\n",
      "absolutely dumb, on the other, I made a somewhat cheerless meal, and\n",
      "bade adieu early. I would have departed by the back way, to get a last\n",
      "glimpse of Catherine and annoy old Joseph; but Hareton received orders\n",
      "to lead up my horse, and my host himself escorted me to the door, so I\n",
      "could not fulfil my wish.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How dreary life gets over in that house!” I reflected, while riding\n",
      "down the road. “What a realisation of something more romantic than a\n",
      "fairy tale it would have been for Mrs. Linton Heathcliff, had she and I\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1802.—This September I was invited to devastate the moors of a friend\n",
      "in the north, and on my journey to his abode, I unexpectedly came\n",
      "within fifteen miles of Gimmerton. The ostler at a roadside\n",
      "public-house was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a\n",
      "cart of very green oats, newly reaped, passed by, and he\n",
      "remarked,—“Yon’s frough Gimmerton, nah! They’re allas three wick’ after\n",
      "other folk wi’ ther harvest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gimmerton?” I repeated—my residence in that locality had already grown\n",
      "dim and dreamy. “Ah! I know. How far is it from this?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Happen fourteen mile o’er th’ hills; and a rough road,” he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange. It was scarcely\n",
      "noon, and I conceived that I might as well pass the night under my own\n",
      "roof as in an inn. Besides, I could spare a day easily to arrange\n",
      "matters with my landlord, and thus save myself the trouble of invading\n",
      "the neighbourhood again. Having rested awhile, I directed my servant to\n",
      "inquire the way to the village; and, with great fatigue to our beasts,\n",
      "we managed the distance in some three hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "I left him there, and proceeded down the valley alone. The grey church\n",
      "looked greyer, and the lonely churchyard lonelier. I distinguished a\n",
      "moor-sheep cropping the short turf on the graves. It was sweet, warm\n",
      "weather—too warm for travelling; but the heat did not hinder me from\n",
      "enjoying the delightful scenery above and below: had I seen it nearer\n",
      "August, I’m sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its\n",
      "solitudes. In winter nothing more dreary, in summer nothing more\n",
      "divine, than those glens shut in by hills, and those bluff, bold swells\n",
      "of heath.\n",
      "\n",
      "I reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for admittance; but the\n",
      "family had retreated into the back premises, I judged, by one thin,\n",
      "blue wreath, curling from the kitchen chimney, and they did not hear. I\n",
      "rode into the court. Under the porch, a girl of nine or ten sat\n",
      "knitting, and an old woman reclined on the housesteps, smoking a\n",
      "meditative pipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is Mrs. Dean within?” I demanded of the dame.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mistress Dean? Nay!” she answered, “she doesn’t bide here: shoo’s up\n",
      "at th’ Heights.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you the housekeeper, then?” I continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eea, Aw keep th’ hause,” she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I’m Mr. Lockwood, the master. Are there any rooms to lodge me\n",
      "in, I wonder? I wish to stay all night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“T’ maister!” she cried in astonishment. “Whet, whoiver knew yah wur\n",
      "coming? Yah sud ha’ send word. They’s nowt norther dry nor mensful\n",
      "abaht t’ place: nowt there isn’t!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She threw down her pipe and bustled in, the girl followed, and I\n",
      "entered too; soon perceiving that her report was true, and, moreover,\n",
      "that I had almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition, I bade her\n",
      "be composed. I would go out for a walk; and, meantime she must try to\n",
      "prepare a corner of a sitting-room for me to sup in, and a bedroom to\n",
      "sleep in. No sweeping and dusting, only good fire and dry sheets were\n",
      "necessary. She seemed willing to do her best; though she thrust the\n",
      "hearth-brush into the grates in mistake for the poker, and\n",
      "malappropriated several other articles of her craft: but I retired,\n",
      "confiding in her energy for a resting-place against my return.\n",
      "Wuthering Heights was the goal of my proposed excursion. An\n",
      "after-thought brought me back, when I had quitted the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All well at the Heights?” I inquired of the woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eea, f’r owt ee knaw!” she answered, skurrying away with a pan of hot\n",
      "cinders.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would have asked why Mrs. Dean had deserted the Grange, but it was\n",
      "impossible to delay her at such a crisis, so I turned away and made my\n",
      "exit, rambling leisurely along, with the glow of a sinking sun behind,\n",
      "and the mild glory of a rising moon in front—one fading, and the other\n",
      "brightening—as I quitted the park, and climbed the stony by-road\n",
      "branching off to Mr. Heathcliff’s dwelling. Before I arrived in sight\n",
      "of it, all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the\n",
      "west: but I could see every pebble on the path, and every blade of\n",
      "grass, by that splendid moon. I had neither to climb the gate nor to\n",
      "knock—it yielded to my hand. That is an improvement, I thought. And I\n",
      "noticed another, by the aid of my nostrils; a fragrance of stocks and\n",
      "wallflowers wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit-trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both doors and lattices were open; and yet, as is usually the case in a\n",
      "coal-district, a fine red fire illumined the chimney: the comfort which\n",
      "the eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable. But the house\n",
      "of Wuthering Heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space\n",
      "for withdrawing out of its influence; and accordingly what inmates\n",
      "there were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows. I\n",
      "could both see them and hear them talk before I entered, and looked and\n",
      "listened in consequence; being moved thereto by a mingled sense of\n",
      "curiosity and envy, that grew as I lingered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Con-_trary_!” said a voice as sweet as a silver bell. “That for the\n",
      "third time, you dunce! I’m not going to tell you again. Recollect, or\n",
      "I’ll pull your hair!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Contrary, then,” answered another, in deep but softened tones. “And\n",
      "now, kiss me, for minding so well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, read it over first correctly, without a single mistake.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The male speaker began to read: he was a young man, respectably dressed\n",
      "and seated at a table, having a book before him. His handsome features\n",
      "glowed with pleasure, and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the\n",
      "page to a small white hand over his shoulder, which recalled him by a\n",
      "smart slap on the cheek, whenever its owner detected such signs of\n",
      "inattention. Its owner stood behind; her light, shining ringlets\n",
      "blending, at intervals, with his brown locks, as she bent to\n",
      "superintend his studies; and her face—it was lucky he could not see her\n",
      "face, or he would never have been so steady. I could; and I bit my lip\n",
      "in spite, at having thrown away the chance I might have had of doing\n",
      "something besides staring at its smiting beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The task was done, not free from further blunders; but the pupil\n",
      "claimed a reward, and received at least five kisses; which, however, he\n",
      "generously returned. Then they came to the door, and from their\n",
      "conversation I judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on\n",
      "the moors. I supposed I should be condemned in Hareton Earnshaw’s\n",
      "heart, if not by his mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal regions\n",
      "if I showed my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then; and\n",
      "feeling very mean and malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge in the\n",
      "kitchen. There was unobstructed admittance on that side also; and at\n",
      "the door sat my old friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song; which\n",
      "was often interrupted from within by harsh words of scorn and\n",
      "intolerance, uttered in far from musical accents.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d rayther, by th’ haulf, hev’ ’em swearing i’ my lugs fro’h morn to\n",
      "neeght, nor hearken ye hahsiver!” said the tenant of the kitchen, in\n",
      "answer to an unheard speech of Nelly’s. “It’s a blazing shame, that I\n",
      "cannot oppen t’ blessed Book, but yah set up them glories to sattan,\n",
      "and all t’ flaysome wickednesses that iver were born into th’ warld!\n",
      "Oh! ye’re a raight nowt; and shoo’s another; and that poor lad ’ll be\n",
      "lost atween ye. Poor lad!” he added, with a groan; “he’s witched: I’m\n",
      "sartin on’t. Oh, Lord, judge ’em, for there’s norther law nor justice\n",
      "among wer rullers!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No! or we should be sitting in flaming fagots, I suppose,” retorted\n",
      "the singer. “But wisht, old man, and read your Bible like a Christian,\n",
      "and never mind me. This is ‘Fairy Annie’s Wedding’—a bonny tune—it goes\n",
      "to a dance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dean was about to recommence, when I advanced; and recognising me\n",
      "directly, she jumped to her feet, crying—“Why, bless you, Mr. Lockwood!\n",
      "How could you think of returning in this way? All’s shut up at\n",
      "Thrushcross Grange. You should have given us notice!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve arranged to be accommodated there, for as long as I shall stay,”\n",
      "I answered. “I depart again to-morrow. And how are you transplanted\n",
      "here, Mrs. Dean? tell me that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Zillah left, and Mr. Heathcliff wished me to come, soon after you went\n",
      "to London, and stay till you returned. But, step in, pray! Have you\n",
      "walked from Gimmerton this evening?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“From the Grange,” I replied; “and while they make me lodging room\n",
      "there, I want to finish my business with your master; because I don’t\n",
      "think of having another opportunity in a hurry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What business, sir?” said Nelly, conducting me into the house. “He’s\n",
      "gone out at present, and won’t return soon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“About the rent,” I answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! then it is with Mrs. Heathcliff you must settle,” she observed;\n",
      "“or rather with me. She has not learnt to manage her affairs yet, and I\n",
      "act for her: there’s nobody else.”\n",

      "“Ah! you have not heard of Heathcliff’s death, I see,” she continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heathcliff dead!” I exclaimed, astonished. “How long ago?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Three months since: but sit down, and let me take your hat, and I’ll\n",
      "tell you all about it. Stop, you have had nothing to eat, have you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want nothing: I have ordered supper at home. You sit down too. I\n",
      "never dreamt of his dying! Let me hear how it came to pass. You say you\n",
      "don’t expect them back for some time—the young people?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No—I have to scold them every evening for their late rambles: but they\n",
      "don’t care for me. At least, have a drink of our old ale; it will do\n",
      "you good: you seem weary.”\n",

      "She hastened to fetch it before I could refuse, and I heard Joseph\n",
      "asking whether “it warn’t a crying scandal that she should have\n",
      "followers at her time of life? And then, to get them jocks out o’ t’\n",

      "\n",
      "She did not stay to retaliate, but re-entered in a minute, bearing a\n",
      "reaming silver pint, whose contents I lauded with becoming earnestness.\n",
      "And afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of Heathcliff’s\n",
      "history. He had a “queer” end, as she expressed it.\n",

      "I was summoned to Wuthering Heights, within a fortnight of your leaving\n",
      "us, she said; and I obeyed joyfully, for Catherine’s sake. My first\n",
      "interview with her grieved and shocked me: she had altered so much\n",
      "since our separation. Mr. Heathcliff did not explain his reasons for\n",
      "taking a new mind about my coming here; he only told me he wanted me,\n",
      "and he was tired of seeing Catherine: I must make the little parlour my\n",
      "sitting-room, and keep her with me. It was enough if he were obliged to\n",
      "see her once or twice a day. She seemed pleased at this arrangement;\n",
      "and, by degrees, I smuggled over a great number of books, and other\n",
      "articles, that had formed her amusement at the Grange; and flattered\n",
      "myself we should get on in tolerable comfort. The delusion did not last\n",
      "long. Catherine, contented at first, in a brief space grew irritable\n",
      "and restless. For one thing, she was forbidden to move out of the\n",
      "garden, and it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as\n",
      "spring drew on; for another, in following the house, I was forced to\n",
      "quit her frequently, and she complained of loneliness: she preferred\n",
      "quarrelling with Joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her\n",
      "solitude. I did not mind their skirmishes: but Hareton was often\n",
      "obliged to seek the kitchen also, when the master wanted to have the\n",
      "house to himself; and though in the beginning she either left it at his\n",
      "approach, or quietly joined in my occupations, and shunned remarking or\n",
      "addressing him—and though he was always as sullen and silent as\n",
      "possible—after a while, she changed her behaviour, and became incapable\n",
      "of letting him alone: talking at him; commenting on his stupidity and\n",
      "idleness; expressing her wonder how he could endure the life he\n",
      "lived—how he could sit a whole evening staring into the fire, and\n",
      "dozing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s just like a dog, is he not, Ellen?” she once observed, “or a\n",
      "cart-horse? He does his work, eats his food, and sleeps eternally! What\n",
      "a blank, dreary mind he must have! Do you ever dream, Hareton? And, if\n",
      "you do, what is it about? But you can’t speak to me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she looked at him; but he would neither open his mouth nor look\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s, perhaps, dreaming now,” she continued. “He twitched his shoulder\n",
      "as Juno twitches hers. Ask him, Ellen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Hareton will ask the master to send you upstairs, if you don’t\n",
      "behave!” I said. He had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his\n",
      "fist, as if tempted to use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know why Hareton never speaks, when I am in the kitchen,” she\n",
      "exclaimed, on another occasion. “He is afraid I shall laugh at him.\n",
      "Ellen, what do you think? He began to teach himself to read once; and,\n",
      "because I laughed, he burned his books, and dropped it: was he not a\n",
      "fool?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Were not you naughty?” I said; “answer me that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps I was,” she went on; “but I did not expect him to be so silly.\n",
      "Hareton, if I gave you a book, would you take it now? I’ll try!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She placed one she had been perusing on his hand; he flung it off, and\n",
      "muttered, if she did not give over, he would break her neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I shall put it here,” she said, “in the table-drawer; and I’m\n",
      "going to bed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it, and departed. But\n",
      "he would not come near it; and so I informed her in the morning, to her\n",
      "great disappointment. I saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness\n",
      "and indolence: her conscience reproved her for frightening him off\n",
      "improving himself: she had done it effectually. But her ingenuity was\n",
      "at work to remedy the injury: while I ironed, or pursued other such\n",
      "stationary employments as I could not well do in the parlour, she would\n",
      "bring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me. When Hareton was\n",
      "there, she generally paused in an interesting part, and left the book\n",
      "lying about: that she did repeatedly; but he was as obstinate as a\n",
      "mule, and, instead of snatching at her bait, in wet weather he took to\n",
      "smoking with Joseph; and they sat like automatons, one on each side of\n",
      "the fire, the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense,\n",
      "as he would have called it, the younger doing his best to seem to\n",
      "disregard it. On fine evenings the latter followed his shooting\n",
      "expeditions, and Catherine yawned and sighed, and teased me to talk to\n",
      "her, and ran off into the court or garden the moment I began; and, as a\n",
      "last resource, cried, and said she was tired of living: her life was\n",
      "useless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Heathcliff, who grew more and more disinclined to society, had\n",
      "almost banished Earnshaw from his apartment. Owing to an accident at\n",
      "the commencement of March, he became for some days a fixture in the\n",
      "kitchen. His gun burst while out on the hills by himself; a splinter\n",
      "cut his arm, and he lost a good deal of blood before he could reach\n",
      "home. The consequence was that, perforce, he was condemned to the\n",
      "fireside and tranquillity, till he made it up again. It suited\n",
      "Catherine to have him there: at any rate, it made her hate her room\n",
      "upstairs more than ever: and she would compel me to find out business\n",
      "below, that she might accompany me.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Easter Monday, Joseph went to Gimmerton fair with some cattle; and,\n",
      "in the afternoon, I was busy getting up linen in the kitchen. Earnshaw\n",
      "sat, morose as usual, at the chimney corner, and my little mistress was\n",
      "beguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the window-panes,\n",
      "varying her amusement by smothered bursts of songs, and whispered\n",
      "ejaculations, and quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the\n",
      "direction of her cousin, who steadfastly smoked, and looked into the\n",
      "grate. At a notice that I could do with her no longer intercepting my\n",
      "light, she removed to the hearthstone. I bestowed little attention on\n",
      "her proceedings, but, presently, I heard her begin—“I’ve found out,\n",
      "Hareton, that I want—that I’m glad—that I should like you to be my\n",
      "cousin now, if you had not grown so cross to me, and so rough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hareton returned no answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hareton, Hareton, Hareton! do you hear?” she continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Get off wi’ ye!” he growled, with uncompromising gruffness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let me take that pipe,” she said, cautiously advancing her hand and\n",
      "abstracting it from his mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before he could attempt to recover it, it was broken, and behind the\n",
      "fire. He swore at her and seized another.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stop,” she cried, “you must listen to me first; and I can’t speak\n",
      "while those clouds are floating in my face.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you go to the devil!” he exclaimed, ferociously, “and let me be!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” she persisted, “I won’t: I can’t tell what to do to make you talk\n",
      "to me; and you are determined not to understand. When I call you\n",
      "stupid, I don’t mean anything: I don’t mean that I despise you. Come,\n",
      "you shall take notice of me, Hareton: you are my cousin, and you shall\n",
      "own me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall have naught to do wi’ you and your mucky pride, and your\n",
      "damned mocking tricks!” he answered. “I’ll go to hell, body and soul,\n",
      "before I look sideways after you again. Side out o’ t’ gate, now, this\n",
      "minute!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Catherine frowned, and retreated to the window-seat chewing her lip,\n",
      "and endeavouring, by humming an eccentric tune, to conceal a growing\n",
      "tendency to sob.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You should be friends with your cousin, Mr. Hareton,” I interrupted,\n",
      "“since she repents of her sauciness. It would do you a great deal of\n",
      "good: it would make you another man to have her for a companion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A companion!” he cried; “when she hates me, and does not think me fit\n",
      "to wipe her shoon! Nay, if it made me a king, I’d not be scorned for\n",
      "seeking her good-will any more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not I who hate you, it is you who hate me!” wept Cathy, no\n",
      "longer disguising her trouble. “You hate me as much as Mr. Heathcliff\n",
      "does, and more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re a damned liar,” began Earnshaw: “why have I made him angry, by\n",
      "taking your part, then, a hundred times? and that when you sneered at\n",
      "and despised me, and—Go on plaguing me, and I’ll step in yonder, and\n",
      "say you worried me out of the kitchen!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t know you took my part,” she answered, drying her eyes; “and I\n",
      "was miserable and bitter at everybody; but now I thank you, and beg you\n",
      "to forgive me: what can I do besides?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She returned to the hearth, and frankly extended her hand. He blackened\n",
      "and scowled like a thunder-cloud, and kept his fists resolutely\n",
      "clenched, and his gaze fixed on the ground. Catherine, by instinct,\n",
      "must have divined it was obdurate perversity, and not dislike, that\n",
      "prompted this dogged conduct; for, after remaining an instant\n",
      "undecided, she stooped and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss. The\n",
      "little rogue thought I had not seen her, and, drawing back, she took\n",
      "her former station by the window, quite demurely. I shook my head\n",
      "reprovingly, and then she blushed and whispered—“Well! what should I\n",
      "have done, Ellen? He wouldn’t shake hands, and he wouldn’t look: I must\n",
      "show him some way that I like him—that I want to be friends.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether the kiss convinced Hareton, I cannot tell: he was very careful,\n",
      "for some minutes, that his face should not be seen, and when he did\n",
      "raise it, he was sadly puzzled where to turn his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white\n",
      "paper, and having tied it with a bit of ribbon, and addressed it to\n",
      "“Mr. Hareton Earnshaw,” she desired me to be her ambassadress, and\n",
      "convey the present to its destined recipient.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And tell him, if he’ll take it, I’ll come and teach him to read it\n",
      "right,” she said; “and, if he refuse it, I’ll go upstairs, and never\n",
      "tease him again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I carried it, and repeated the message; anxiously watched by my\n",
      "employer. Hareton would not open his fingers, so I laid it on his knee.\n",
      "He did not strike it off, either. I returned to my work. Catherine\n",
      "leaned her head and arms on the table, till she heard the slight rustle\n",
      "of the covering being removed; then she stole away, and quietly seated\n",
      "herself beside her cousin. He trembled, and his face glowed: all his\n",
      "rudeness and all his surly harshness had deserted him: he could not\n",
      "summon courage, at first, to utter a syllable in reply to her\n",
      "questioning look, and her murmured petition.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say you forgive me, Hareton, do. You can make me so happy by speaking\n",
      "that little word.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He muttered something inaudible.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you’ll be my friend?” added Catherine, interrogatively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay, you’ll be ashamed of me every day of your life,” he answered;\n",
      "“and the more ashamed, the more you know me; and I cannot bide it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So you won’t be my friend?” she said, smiling as sweet as honey, and\n",
      "creeping close up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I overheard no further distinguishable talk, but, on looking round\n",
      "again, I perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of\n",
      "the accepted book, that I did not doubt the treaty had been ratified on\n",
      "both sides; and the enemies were, thenceforth, sworn allies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The work they studied was full of costly pictures; and those and their\n",
      "position had charm enough to keep them unmoved till Joseph came home.\n",
      "He, poor man, was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of Catherine seated\n",
      "on the same bench with Hareton Earnshaw, leaning her hand on his\n",
      "shoulder; and confounded at his favourite’s endurance of her proximity:\n",
      "it affected him too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that\n",
      "night. His emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew, as\n",
      "he solemnly spread his large Bible on the table, and overlaid it with\n",
      "dirty bank-notes from his pocket-book, the produce of the day’s\n",
      "transactions. At length he summoned Hareton from his seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tak’ these in to t’ maister, lad,” he said, “and bide there. I’s gang\n",
      "up to my own rahm. This hoile’s neither mensful nor seemly for us: we\n",
      "mun side out and seearch another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, Catherine,” I said, “we must ‘side out’ too: I’ve done my\n",
      "ironing. Are you ready to go?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not eight o’clock!” she answered, rising unwillingly. “Hareton,\n",
      "I’ll leave this book upon the chimney-piece, and I’ll bring some more\n",
      "to-morrow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ony books that yah leave, I shall tak’ into th’ hahse,” said Joseph,\n",
      "“and it’ll be mitch if yah find ’em agean; soa, yah may plase yerseln!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers; and, smiling as\n",
      "she passed Hareton, went singing upstairs: lighter of heart, I venture\n",
      "to say, than ever she had been under that roof before; except, perhaps,\n",
      "during her earliest visits to Linton.\n",
      "\n",
      "The intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly; though it encountered\n",
      "temporary interruptions. Earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish,\n",
      "and my young lady was no philosopher, and no paragon of patience; but\n",
      "both their minds tending to the same point—one loving and desiring to\n",
      "esteem, and the other loving and desiring to be esteemed—they contrived\n",
      "in the end to reach it.\n",
      "\n",
      "You see, Mr. Lockwood, it was easy enough to win Mrs. Heathcliff’s\n",
      "heart. But now, I’m glad you did not try. The crown of all my wishes\n",
      "will be the union of those two. I shall envy no one on their wedding\n",

      "\n",
      "On the morrow of that Monday, Earnshaw being still unable to follow his\n",
      "ordinary employments, and therefore remaining about the house, I\n",
      "speedily found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me,\n",
      "as heretofore. She got downstairs before me, and out into the garden,\n",
      "where she had seen her cousin performing some easy work; and when I\n",
      "went to bid them come to breakfast, I saw she had persuaded him to\n",
      "clear a large space of ground from currant and gooseberry bushes, and\n",
      "they were busy planning together an importation of plants from the\n",
      "Grange.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished in a\n",
      "brief half-hour; the black-currant trees were the apple of Joseph’s\n",
      "eye, and she had just fixed her choice of a flower-bed in the midst of\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There! That will be all shown to the master,” I exclaimed, “the minute\n",
      "it is discovered. And what excuse have you to offer for taking such\n",
      "liberties with the garden? We shall have a fine explosion on the head\n",
      "of it: see if we don’t! Mr. Hareton, I wonder you should have no more\n",
      "wit than to go and make that mess at her bidding!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d forgotten they were Joseph’s,” answered Earnshaw, rather puzzled;\n",
      "“but I’ll tell him I did it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We always ate our meals with Mr. Heathcliff. I held the mistress’s post\n",
      "in making tea and carving; so I was indispensable at table. Catherine\n",
      "usually sat by me, but to-day she stole nearer to Hareton; and I\n",
      "presently saw she would have no more discretion in her friendship than\n",
      "she had in her hostility.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, mind you don’t talk with and notice your cousin too much,” were\n",
      "my whispered instructions as we entered the room. “It will certainly\n",
      "annoy Mr. Heathcliff, and he’ll be mad at you both.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m not going to,” she answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The minute after, she had sidled to him, and was sticking primroses in\n",
      "his plate of porridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "He dared not speak to her there: he dared hardly look; and yet she went\n",
      "on teasing, till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh.\n",
      "I frowned, and then she glanced towards the master: whose mind was\n",
      "occupied on other subjects than his company, as his countenance\n",
      "evinced; and she grew serious for an instant, scrutinizing him with\n",
      "deep gravity. Afterwards she turned, and recommenced her nonsense; at\n",
      "last, Hareton uttered a smothered laugh. Mr. Heathcliff started; his\n",
      "eye rapidly surveyed our faces. Catherine met it with her accustomed\n",
      "look of nervousness and yet defiance, which he abhorred.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is well you are out of my reach,” he exclaimed. “What fiend\n",
      "possesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those infernal\n",
      "eyes? Down with them! and don’t remind me of your existence again. I\n",
      "thought I had cured you of laughing.”\n",
      "\n",

      "Hareton looked at his plate, and did not repeat the confession. Mr.\n",

      "people prudently shifted wider asunder, so I anticipated no further\n",
      "disturbance during that sitting: when Joseph appeared at the door,\n",
      "revealing by his quivering lip and furious eyes that the outrage\n",
      "committed on his precious shrubs was detected. He must have seen Cathy\n",
      "and her cousin about the spot before he examined it, for while his jaws\n",
      "worked like those of a cow chewing its cud, and rendered his speech\n",
      "difficult to understand, he began:—\n",

      "“I mun hev’ my wage, and I mun goa! I _hed_ aimed to dee wheare I’d\n",

      "The latter was speechless; his cousin replied—“You shouldn’t grudge a\n",

      "\n",
      "“Your land, insolent slut! You never had any,” said Heathcliff.\n",

      "biting a piece of crust, the remnant of her breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Silence!” he exclaimed. “Get done, and begone!”\n",

      "I’ll kill her, Ellen Dean, if you let her come into my sight again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hareton tried, under his breath, to persuade her to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Drag her away!” he cried, savagely. “Are you staying to talk?” And he\n",
      "approached to execute his own command.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’ll not obey you, wicked man, any more,” said Catherine; “and he’ll\n",

      "for ever!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had his hand in her hair; Hareton attempted to release her locks,\n",

      "flashed; he seemed ready to tear Catherine in pieces, and I was just\n",
      "worked up to risk coming to the rescue, when of a sudden his fingers\n",
      "relaxed; he shifted his grasp from her head to her arm, and gazed\n",
      "intently in her face. Then he drew his hand over his eyes, stood a\n",
      "moment to collect himself apparently, and turning anew to Catherine,\n",
      "said, with assumed calmness—“You must learn to avoid putting me in a\n",
      "passion, or I shall really murder you some time! Go with Mrs. Dean, and\n",
      "keep with her; and confine your insolence to her ears. As to Hareton\n",
      "Earnshaw, if I see him listen to you, I’ll send him seeking his bread\n",
      "where he can get it! Your love will make him an outcast and a beggar.\n",
      "Nelly, take her; and leave me, all of you! Leave me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I led my young lady out: she was too glad of her escape to resist; the\n",
      "other followed, and Mr. Heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner.\n",
      "I had counselled Catherine to dine upstairs; but, as soon as he\n",
      "perceived her vacant seat, he sent me to call her. He spoke to none of\n",
      "us, ate very little, and went out directly afterwards, intimating that\n",
      "he should not return before evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two new friends established themselves in the house during his\n",
      "absence; where I heard Hareton sternly check his cousin, on her\n",
      "offering a revelation of her father-in-law’s conduct to his father. He\n",
      "said he wouldn’t suffer a word to be uttered in his disparagement: if\n",
      "he were the devil, it didn’t signify; he would stand by him; and he’d\n",
      "rather she would abuse himself, as she used to, than begin on Mr.\n",
      "Heathcliff. Catherine was waxing cross at this; but he found means to\n",
      "make her hold her tongue, by asking how she would like _him_ to speak\n",
      "ill of her father? Then she comprehended that Earnshaw took the\n",
      "master’s reputation home to himself; and was attached by ties stronger\n",
      "than reason could break—chains, forged by habit, which it would be\n",
      "cruel to attempt to loosen. She showed a good heart, thenceforth, in\n",
      "avoiding both complaints and expressions of antipathy concerning\n",
      "Heathcliff; and confessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured to\n",
      "raise a bad spirit between him and Hareton: indeed, I don’t believe she\n",
      "has ever breathed a syllable, in the latter’s hearing, against her\n",
      "oppressor since.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this slight disagreement was over, they were friends again, and as\n",
      "busy as possible in their several occupations of pupil and teacher. I\n",
      "came in to sit with them, after I had done my work; and I felt so\n",
      "soothed and comforted to watch them, that I did not notice how time got\n",
      "on. You know, they both appeared in a measure my children: I had long\n",
      "been proud of one; and now, I was sure, the other would be a source of\n",
      "equal satisfaction. His honest, warm, and intelligent nature shook off\n",
      "rapidly the clouds of ignorance and degradation in which it had been\n",
      "bred; and Catherine’s sincere commendations acted as a spur to his\n",
      "industry. His brightening mind brightened his features, and added\n",
      "spirit and nobility to their aspect: I could hardly fancy it the same\n",
      "individual I had beheld on the day I discovered my little lady at\n",
      "Wuthering Heights, after her expedition to the Crags. While I admired\n",
      "and they laboured, dusk drew on, and with it returned the master. He\n",
      "came upon us quite unexpectedly, entering by the front way, and had a\n",
      "full view of the whole three, ere we could raise our heads to glance at\n",
      "him. Well, I reflected, there was never a pleasanter, or more harmless\n",
      "sight; and it will be a burning shame to scold them. The red fire-light\n",
      "glowed on their two bonny heads, and revealed their faces animated with\n",
      "the eager interest of children; for, though he was twenty-three and she\n",
      "eighteen, each had so much of novelty to feel and learn, that neither\n",
      "experienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity.\n",
      "\n",
      "They lifted their eyes together, to encounter Mr. Heathcliff: perhaps\n",
      "you have never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar, and they\n",
      "are those of Catherine Earnshaw. The present Catherine has no other\n",
      "likeness to her, except a breadth of forehead, and a certain arch of\n",
      "the nostril that makes her appear rather haughty, whether she will or\n",
      "not. With Hareton the resemblance is carried farther: it is singular at\n",
      "all times, _then_ it was particularly striking; because his senses were\n",
      "alert, and his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity. I suppose\n",
      "this resemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff: he walked to the hearth in\n",
      "evident agitation; but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young\n",
      "man: or, I should say, altered its character; for it was there yet. He\n",
      "took the book from his hand, and glanced at the open page, then\n",
      "returned it without any observation; merely signing Catherine away: her\n",
      "companion lingered very little behind her, and I was about to depart\n",
      "also, but he bid me sit still.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a poor conclusion, is it not?” he observed, having brooded\n",
      "a while on the scene he had just witnessed: “an absurd termination to\n",
      "my violent exertions? I get levers and mattocks to demolish the two\n",
      "houses, and train myself to be capable of working like Hercules, and\n",
      "when everything is ready and in my power, I find the will to lift a\n",
      "slate off either roof has vanished! My old enemies have not beaten me;\n",
      "now would be the precise time to revenge myself on their\n",
      "representatives: I could do it; and none could hinder me. But where is\n",
      "the use? I don’t care for striking: I can’t take the trouble to raise\n",
      "my hand! That sounds as if I had been labouring the whole time only to\n",
      "exhibit a fine trait of magnanimity. It is far from being the case: I\n",
      "have lost the faculty of enjoying their destruction, and I am too idle\n",
      "to destroy for nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nelly, there is a strange change approaching; I’m in its shadow at\n",
      "present. I take so little interest in my daily life that I hardly\n",
      "remember to eat and drink. Those two who have left the room are the\n",
      "only objects which retain a distinct material appearance to me; and\n",
      "that appearance causes me pain, amounting to agony. About _her_ I won’t\n",
      "speak; and I don’t desire to think; but I earnestly wish she were\n",
      "invisible: her presence invokes only maddening sensations. _He_ moves\n",
      "me differently: and yet if I could do it without seeming insane, I’d\n",
      "never see him again! You’ll perhaps think me rather inclined to become\n",
      "so,” he added, making an effort to smile, “if I try to describe the\n",
      "thousand forms of past associations and ideas he awakens or embodies.\n",
      "But you’ll not talk of what I tell you; and my mind is so eternally\n",
      "secluded in itself, it is tempting at last to turn it out to another.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Five minutes ago Hareton seemed a personification of my youth, not a\n",
      "human being; I felt to him in such a variety of ways, that it would\n",
      "have been impossible to have accosted him rationally. In the first\n",
      "place, his startling likeness to Catherine connected him fearfully with\n",
      "her. That, however, which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my\n",
      "imagination, is actually the least: for what is not connected with her\n",
      "to me? and what does not recall her? I cannot look down to this floor,\n",
      "but her features are shaped in the flags! In every cloud, in every\n",
      "tree—filling the air at night, and caught by glimpses in every object\n",
      "by day—I am surrounded with her image! The most ordinary faces of men\n",
      "and women—my own features—mock me with a resemblance. The entire world\n",
      "is a dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist, and that I\n",
      "have lost her! Well, Hareton’s aspect was the ghost of my immortal\n",
      "love; of my wild endeavours to hold my right; my degradation, my pride,\n",
      "my happiness, and my anguish—\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you: only it will let you\n",
      "know why, with a reluctance to be always alone, his society is no\n",
      "benefit; rather an aggravation of the constant torment I suffer: and it\n",
      "partly contributes to render me regardless how he and his cousin go on\n",
      "together. I can give them no attention any more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what do you mean by a _change_, Mr. Heathcliff?” I said, alarmed\n",
      "at his manner: though he was neither in danger of losing his senses,\n",
      "nor dying, according to my judgment: he was quite strong and healthy;\n",
      "and, as to his reason, from childhood he had a delight in dwelling on\n",
      "dark things, and entertaining odd fancies. He might have had a\n",
      "monomania on the subject of his departed idol; but on every other point\n",
      "his wits were as sound as mine.\n",

      "temperate mode of living, and unperilous occupations, I ought to, and\n",
      "probably _shall_, remain above ground till there is scarcely a black\n",
      "hair on my head. And yet I cannot continue in this condition! I have to\n",
      "remind myself to breathe—almost to remind my heart to beat! And it is\n",
      "like bending back a stiff spring: it is by compulsion that I do the\n",
      "slightest act not prompted by one thought; and by compulsion that I\n",
      "notice anything alive or dead, which is not associated with one\n",
      "universal idea. I have a single wish, and my whole being and faculties\n",
      "are yearning to attain it. They have yearned towards it so long, and so\n",
      "unwaveringly, that I’m convinced it _will_ be reached—and\n",
      "_soon_—because it has devoured my existence: I am swallowed up in the\n",
      "anticipation of its fulfilment. My confessions have not relieved me;\n",
      "but they may account for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour\n",
      "which I show. O God! It is a long fight; I wish it were over!”\n",

      "was inclined to believe, as he said Joseph did, that conscience had\n",

      "at the period of which I speak, he was just the same as then; only\n",

      "For some days after that evening, Mr. Heathcliff shunned meeting us at\n",
      "meals; yet he would not consent formally to exclude Hareton and Cathy.\n",
      "He had an aversion to yielding so completely to his feelings, choosing\n",
      "rather to absent himself; and eating once in twenty-four hours seemed\n",
      "sufficient sustenance for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night, after the family were in bed, I heard him go downstairs, and\n",
      "out at the front door. I did not hear him re-enter, and in the morning\n",
      "I found he was still away. We were in April then: the weather was sweet\n",
      "and warm, the grass as green as showers and sun could make it, and the\n",
      "two dwarf apple-trees near the southern wall in full bloom. After\n",
      "breakfast, Catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with\n",
      "my work under the fir-trees at the end of the house; and she beguiled\n",
      "Hareton, who had perfectly recovered from his accident, to dig and\n",
      "arrange her little garden, which was shifted to that corner by the\n",
      "influence of Joseph’s complaints. I was comfortably revelling in the\n",
      "spring fragrance around, and the beautiful soft blue overhead, when my\n",
      "young lady, who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose\n",
      "roots for a border, returned only half laden, and informed us that Mr.\n",
      "Heathcliff was coming in. “And he spoke to me,” she added, with a\n",
      "perplexed countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did he say?” asked Hareton.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He told me to begone as fast as I could,” she answered. “But he looked\n",

      "\n",
      "“How?” he inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, almost bright and cheerful. No, _almost_ nothing—_very much_\n",

      "\n",
      "“Night-walking amuses him, then,” I remarked, affecting a careless\n",
      "manner: in reality as surprised as she was, and anxious to ascertain\n",
      "the truth of her statement; for to see the master looking glad would\n",
      "not be an every-day spectacle. I framed an excuse to go in. Heathcliff\n",
      "stood at the open door; he was pale, and he trembled: yet, certainly,\n",
      "he had a strange joyful glitter in his eyes, that altered the aspect of\n",
      "his whole face.\n",

      "“Will you have some breakfast?” I said. “You must be hungry, rambling\n",

      "like to ask directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I’m not hungry,” he answered, averting his head, and speaking\n",
      "rather contemptuously, as if he guessed I was trying to divine the\n",
      "occasion of his good humour.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt perplexed: I didn’t know whether it were not a proper\n",
      "opportunity to offer a bit of admonition.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think it right to wander out of doors,” I observed, “instead\n",

      "me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He took his knife and fork, and was going to commence eating, when the\n",
      "inclination appeared to become suddenly extinct. He laid them on the\n",
      "table, looked eagerly towards the window, then rose and went out. We\n",
      "saw him walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal,\n",

      "unnatural—it was unnatural—appearance of joy under his black brows; the\n",
      "same bloodless hue, and his teeth visible, now and then, in a kind of\n",
      "smile; his frame shivering, not as one shivers with chill or weakness,\n",

      "And, Nelly, once for all, let me beg you to warn Hareton and the other\n",
      "away from me. I wish to be troubled by nobody: I wish to have this\n",
      "place to myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there some new reason for this banishment?” I inquired. “Tell me\n",
      "why you are so queer, Mr. Heathcliff? Where were you last night? I’m\n",
      "not putting the question through idle curiosity, but—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are putting the question through very idle curiosity,” he\n",
      "interrupted, with a laugh. “Yet I’ll answer it. Last night I was on the\n",
      "threshold of hell. To-day, I am within sight of my heaven. I have my\n",
      "eyes on it: hardly three feet to sever me! And now you’d better go!\n",
      "You’ll neither see nor hear anything to frighten you, if you refrain\n",
      "from prying.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Having swept the hearth and wiped the table, I departed; more perplexed\n",
      "than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not quit the house again that afternoon, and no one intruded on\n",
      "his solitude; till, at eight o’clock, I deemed it proper, though\n",
      "unsummoned, to carry a candle and his supper to him. He was leaning\n",
      "against the ledge of an open lattice, but not looking out: his face was\n",
      "turned to the interior gloom. The fire had smouldered to ashes; the\n",
      "room was filled with the damp, mild air of the cloudy evening; and so\n",
      "still, that not only the murmur of the beck down Gimmerton was\n",
      "distinguishable, but its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles, or\n",
      "through the large stones which it could not cover. I uttered an\n",
      "ejaculation of discontent at seeing the dismal grate, and commenced\n",
      "shutting the casements, one after another, till I came to his.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Must I close this?” I asked, in order to rouse him; for he would not\n",
      "stir.\n",
      "\n",
      "The light flashed on his features as I spoke. Oh, Mr. Lockwood, I\n",
      "cannot express what a terrible start I got by the momentary view! Those\n",
      "deep black eyes! That smile, and ghastly paleness! It appeared to me,\n",
      "not Mr. Heathcliff, but a goblin; and, in my terror, I let the candle\n",
      "bend towards the wall, and it left me in darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, close it,” he replied, in his familiar voice. “There, that is\n",
      "pure awkwardness! Why did you hold the candle horizontally? Be quick,\n",
      "and bring another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I hurried out in a foolish state of dread, and said to Joseph—“The\n",
      "master wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire.” For I\n",
      "dared not go in myself again just then.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joseph rattled some fire into the shovel, and went: but he brought it\n",
      "back immediately, with the supper-tray in his other hand, explaining\n",
      "that Mr. Heathcliff was going to bed, and he wanted nothing to eat till\n",
      "morning. We heard him mount the stairs directly; he did not proceed to\n",
      "his ordinary chamber, but turned into that with the panelled bed: its\n",
      "window, as I mentioned before, is wide enough for anybody to get\n",
      "through; and it struck me that he plotted another midnight excursion,\n",
      "of which he had rather we had no suspicion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he a ghoul or a vampire?” I mused. I had read of such hideous\n",
      "incarnate demons. And then I set myself to reflect how I had tended him\n",
      "in infancy, and watched him grow to youth, and followed him almost\n",
      "through his whole course; and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to\n",
      "that sense of horror. “But where did he come from, the little dark\n",
      "thing, harboured by a good man to his bane?” muttered Superstition, as\n",
      "I dozed into unconsciousness. And I began, half dreaming, to weary\n",
      "myself with imagining some fit parentage for him; and, repeating my\n",
      "waking meditations, I tracked his existence over again, with grim\n",
      "variations; at last, picturing his death and funeral: of which, all I\n",
      "can remember is, being exceedingly vexed at having the task of\n",
      "dictating an inscription for his monument, and consulting the sexton\n",
      "about it; and, as he had no surname, and we could not tell his age, we\n",
      "were obliged to content ourselves with the single word, “Heathcliff.”\n",
      "That came true: we were. If you enter the kirkyard, you’ll read, on his\n",
      "headstone, only that, and the date of his death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dawn restored me to common sense. I rose, and went into the garden, as\n",
      "soon as I could see, to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his\n",
      "window. There were none. “He has stayed at home,” I thought, “and he’ll\n",
      "be all right to-day.” I prepared breakfast for the household, as was my\n",
      "usual custom, but told Hareton and Catherine to get theirs ere the\n",
      "master came down, for he lay late. They preferred taking it out of\n",
      "doors, under the trees, and I set a little table to accommodate them.\n",
      "\n",
      "On my re-entrance, I found Mr. Heathcliff below. He and Joseph were\n",
      "conversing about some farming business; he gave clear, minute\n",
      "directions concerning the matter discussed, but he spoke rapidly, and\n",
      "turned his head continually aside, and had the same excited expression,\n",
      "even more exaggerated. When Joseph quitted the room he took his seat in\n",
      "the place he generally chose, and I put a basin of coffee before him.\n",
      "He drew it nearer, and then rested his arms on the table, and looked at\n",
      "the opposite wall, as I supposed, surveying one particular portion, up\n",
      "and down, with glittering, restless eyes, and with such eager interest\n",
      "that he stopped breathing during half a minute together.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come now,” I exclaimed, pushing some bread against his hand, “eat and\n",
      "drink that, while it is hot: it has been waiting near an hour.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He didn’t notice me, and yet he smiled. I’d rather have seen him gnash\n",
      "his teeth than smile so.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Heathcliff! master!” I cried, “don’t, for God’s sake, stare as if\n",
      "you saw an unearthly vision.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t, for God’s sake, shout so loud,” he replied. “Turn round, and\n",
      "tell me, are we by ourselves?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course,” was my answer; “of course we are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, I involuntarily obeyed him, as if I was not quite sure. With a\n",
      "sweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in front among the\n",
      "breakfast things, and leant forward to gaze more at his ease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I perceived he was not looking at the wall; for when I regarded\n",
      "him alone, it seemed exactly that he gazed at something within two\n",
      "yards’ distance. And whatever it was, it communicated, apparently, both\n",
      "pleasure and pain in exquisite extremes: at least the anguished, yet\n",
      "raptured, expression of his countenance suggested that idea. The\n",
      "fancied object was not fixed, either: his eyes pursued it with\n",
      "unwearied diligence, and, even in speaking to me, were never weaned\n",
      "away. I vainly reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food: if\n",
      "he stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties, if he\n",
      "stretched his hand out to get a piece of bread, his fingers clenched\n",
      "before they reached it, and remained on the table, forgetful of their\n",
      "aim.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat, a model of patience, trying to attract his absorbed attention\n",
      "from its engrossing speculation; till he grew irritable, and got up,\n",
      "asking why I would not allow him to have his own time in taking his\n",
      "meals? and saying that on the next occasion I needn’t wait: I might set\n",
      "the things down and go. Having uttered these words he left the house,\n",
      "slowly sauntered down the garden path, and disappeared through the\n",
      "gate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hours crept anxiously by: another evening came. I did not retire to\n",
      "rest till late, and when I did, I could not sleep. He returned after\n",
      "midnight, and, instead of going to bed, shut himself into the room\n",
      "beneath. I listened, and tossed about, and, finally, dressed and\n",
      "descended. It was too irksome to lie there, harassing my brain with a\n",
      "hundred idle misgivings.\n",
      "\n",
      "I distinguished Mr. Heathcliff’s step, restlessly measuring the floor,\n",
      "and he frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration, resembling a\n",
      "groan. He muttered detached words also; the only one I could catch was\n",
      "the name of Catherine, coupled with some wild term of endearment or\n",
      "suffering; and spoken as one would speak to a person present; low and\n",
      "earnest, and wrung from the depth of his soul. I had not courage to\n",
      "walk straight into the apartment; but I desired to divert him from his\n",
      "reverie, and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire, stirred it, and\n",
      "began to scrape the cinders. It drew him forth sooner than I expected.\n",
      "He opened the door immediately, and said—“Nelly, come here—is it\n",
      "morning? Come in with your light.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is striking four,” I answered. “You want a candle to take upstairs:\n",
      "you might have lit one at this fire.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I don’t wish to go upstairs,” he said. “Come in, and kindle _me_ a\n",
      "fire, and do anything there is to do about the room.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must blow the coals red first, before I can carry any,” I replied,\n",
      "getting a chair and the bellows.\n",
      "\n",
      "He roamed to and fro, meantime, in a state approaching distraction; his\n",
      "heavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for\n",
      "common breathing between.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When day breaks I’ll send for Green,” he said; “I wish to make some\n",
      "legal inquiries of him while I can bestow a thought on those matters,\n",
      "and while I can act calmly. I have not written my will yet; and how to\n",
      "leave my property I cannot determine. I wish I could annihilate it from\n",
      "the face of the earth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would not talk so, Mr. Heathcliff,” I interposed. “Let your will be\n",
      "a while: you’ll be spared to repent of your many injustices yet! I\n",
      "never expected that your nerves would be disordered: they are, at\n",
      "present, marvellously so, however; and almost entirely through your own\n",
      "fault. The way you’ve passed these three last days might knock up a\n",
      "Titan. Do take some food, and some repose. You need only look at\n",
      "yourself in a glass to see how you require both. Your cheeks are\n",
      "hollow, and your eyes blood-shot, like a person starving with hunger\n",
      "and going blind with loss of sleep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not my fault that I cannot eat or rest,” he replied. “I assure\n",
      "you it is through no settled designs. I’ll do both, as soon as I\n",
      "possibly can. But you might as well bid a man struggling in the water\n",
      "rest within arms’ length of the shore! I must reach it first, and then\n",
      "I’ll rest. Well, never mind Mr. Green: as to repenting of my\n",
      "injustices, I’ve done no injustice, and I repent of nothing. I’m too\n",
      "happy; and yet I’m not happy enough. My soul’s bliss kills my body, but\n",
      "does not satisfy itself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Happy, master?” I cried. “Strange happiness! If you would hear me\n",
      "without being angry, I might offer some advice that would make you\n",
      "happier.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is that?” he asked. “Give it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are aware, Mr. Heathcliff,” I said, “that from the time you were\n",
      "thirteen years old you have lived a selfish, unchristian life; and\n",
      "probably hardly had a Bible in your hands during all that period. You\n",
      "must have forgotten the contents of the book, and you may not have\n",
      "space to search it now. Could it be hurtful to send for some one—some\n",
      "minister of any denomination, it does not matter which—to explain it,\n",
      "and show you how very far you have erred from its precepts; and how\n",
      "unfit you will be for its heaven, unless a change takes place before\n",
      "you die?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m rather obliged than angry, Nelly,” he said, “for you remind me of\n",
      "the manner in which I desire to be buried. It is to be carried to the\n",
      "churchyard in the evening. You and Hareton may, if you please,\n",
      "accompany me: and mind, particularly, to notice that the sexton obeys\n",
      "my directions concerning the two coffins! No minister need come; nor\n",
      "need anything be said over me.—I tell you I have nearly attained _my_\n",
      "heaven; and that of others is altogether unvalued and uncoveted by me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast, and died by that\n",
      "means, and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk?” I\n",
      "said, shocked at his godless indifference. “How would you like it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They won’t do that,” he replied: “if they did, you must have me\n",
      "removed secretly; and if you neglect it you shall prove, practically,\n",
      "that the dead are not annihilated!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired\n",
      "to his den, and I breathed freer. But in the afternoon, while Joseph\n",
      "and Hareton were at their work, he came into the kitchen again, and,\n",
      "with a wild look, bid me come and sit in the house: he wanted somebody\n",
      "with him. I declined; telling him plainly that his strange talk and\n",
      "manner frightened me, and I had neither the nerve nor the will to be\n",
      "his companion alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe you think me a fiend,” he said, with his dismal laugh:\n",
      "“something too horrible to live under a decent roof.” Then turning to\n",
      "Catherine, who was there, and who drew behind me at his approach, he\n",
      "added, half sneeringly,—“Will _you_ come, chuck? I’ll not hurt you. No!\n",
      "to you I’ve made myself worse than the devil. Well, there is _one_ who\n",
      "won’t shrink from my company! By God! she’s relentless. Oh, damn it!\n",
      "It’s unutterably too much for flesh and blood to bear—even mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He solicited the society of no one more. At dusk he went into his\n",
      "chamber. Through the whole night, and far into the morning, we heard\n",
      "him groaning and murmuring to himself. Hareton was anxious to enter;\n",
      "but I bid him fetch Mr. Kenneth, and he should go in and see him. When\n",
      "he came, and I requested admittance and tried to open the door, I found\n",
      "it locked; and Heathcliff bid us be damned. He was better, and would be\n",
      "left alone; so the doctor went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following evening was very wet: indeed, it poured down till\n",
      "day-dawn; and, as I took my morning walk round the house, I observed\n",
      "the master’s window swinging open, and the rain driving straight in. He\n",
      "cannot be in bed, I thought: those showers would drench him through. He\n",
      "must either be up or out. But I’ll make no more ado, I’ll go boldly and\n",
      "look.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key, I ran to\n",
      "unclose the panels, for the chamber was vacant; quickly pushing them\n",
      "aside, I peeped in. Mr. Heathcliff was there—laid on his back. His eyes\n",
      "met mine so keen and fierce, I started; and then he seemed to smile. I\n",
      "could not think him dead: but his face and throat were washed with\n",
      "rain; the bed-clothes dripped, and he was perfectly still. The lattice,\n",
      "flapping to and fro, had grazed one hand that rested on the sill; no\n",
      "blood trickled from the broken skin, and when I put my fingers to it, I\n",
      "could doubt no more: he was dead and stark!\n",
      "\n",
      "I hasped the window; I combed his black long hair from his forehead; I\n",
      "tried to close his eyes: to extinguish, if possible, that frightful,\n",
      "life-like gaze of exultation before any one else beheld it. They would\n",
      "not shut: they seemed to sneer at my attempts; and his parted lips and\n",
      "sharp white teeth sneered too! Taken with another fit of cowardice, I\n",
      "cried out for Joseph. Joseph shuffled up and made a noise, but\n",
      "resolutely refused to meddle with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Th’ divil’s harried off his soul,” he cried, “and he may hev’ his\n",
      "carcass into t’ bargin, for aught I care! Ech! what a wicked ’un he\n",
      "looks, girning at death!” and the old sinner grinned in mockery. I\n",
      "thought he intended to cut a caper round the bed; but suddenly\n",
      "composing himself, he fell on his knees, and raised his hands, and\n",
      "returned thanks that the lawful master and the ancient stock were\n",
      "restored to their rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt stunned by the awful event; and my memory unavoidably recurred\n",
      "to former times with a sort of oppressive sadness. But poor Hareton,\n",
      "the most wronged, was the only one who really suffered much. He sat by\n",
      "the corpse all night, weeping in bitter earnest. He pressed its hand,\n",
      "and kissed the sarcastic, savage face that every one else shrank from\n",
      "contemplating; and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs\n",
      "naturally from a generous heart, though it be tough as tempered steel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master\n",
      "died. I concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four\n",
      "days, fearing it might lead to trouble, and then, I am persuaded, he\n",
      "did not abstain on purpose: it was the consequence of his strange\n",
      "illness, not the cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "We buried him, to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood, as he wished.\n",
      "Earnshaw and I, the sexton, and six men to carry the coffin,\n",
      "comprehended the whole attendance. The six men departed when they had\n",
      "let it down into the grave: we stayed to see it covered. Hareton, with\n",
      "a streaming face, dug green sods, and laid them over the brown mould\n",
      "himself: at present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion\n",
      "mounds—and I hope its tenant sleeps as soundly. But the country folks,\n",
      "if you ask them, would swear on the Bible that he _walks_: there are\n",
      "those who speak to having met him near the church, and on the moor, and\n",
      "even within this house. Idle tales, you’ll say, and so say I. Yet that\n",
      "old man by the kitchen fire affirms he has seen two on ’em looking out\n",
      "of his chamber window on every rainy night since his death:—and an odd\n",
      "thing happened to me about a month ago. I was going to the Grange one\n",
      "evening—a dark evening, threatening thunder—and, just at the turn of\n",
      "the Heights, I encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs\n",
      "before him; he was crying terribly; and I supposed the lambs were\n",
      "skittish, and would not be guided.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is the matter, my little man?” I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s Heathcliff and a woman yonder, under t’ nab,” he blubbered,\n",
      "“un’ I darnut pass ’em.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw nothing; but neither the sheep nor he would go on, so I bid him\n",
      "take the road lower down. He probably raised the phantoms from\n",
      "thinking, as he traversed the moors alone, on the nonsense he had heard\n",
      "his parents and companions repeat. Yet, still, I don’t like being out\n",
      "in the dark now; and I don’t like being left by myself in this grim\n",
      "house: I cannot help it; I shall be glad when they leave it, and shift\n",
      "to the Grange.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are going to the Grange, then?” I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” answered Mrs. Dean, “as soon as they are married, and that will\n",
      "be on New Year’s Day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And who will live here then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, Joseph will take care of the house, and, perhaps, a lad to keep\n",
      "him company. They will live in the kitchen, and the rest will be shut\n",
      "up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it?” I observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Mr. Lockwood,” said Nelly, shaking her head. “I believe the dead\n",
      "are at peace: but it is not right to speak of them with levity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment the garden gate swung to; the ramblers were returning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_They_ are afraid of nothing,” I grumbled, watching their approach\n",
      "through the window. “Together, they would brave Satan and all his\n",
      "legions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As they stepped on to the door-stones, and halted to take a last look\n",
      "at the moon—or, more correctly, at each other by her light—I felt\n",
      "irresistibly impelled to escape them again; and, pressing a remembrance\n",
      "into the hand of Mrs. Dean, and disregarding her expostulations at my\n",
      "rudeness, I vanished through the kitchen as they opened the house-door;\n",
      "and so should have confirmed Joseph in his opinion of his\n",
      "fellow-servant’s gay indiscretions, had he not fortunately recognised\n",
      "me for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his\n",
